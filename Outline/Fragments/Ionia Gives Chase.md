Ionia sat down on a stump next to the lunch basket, her stomach reminding her it had been hours since breakfast. As she bent down to open the basket, a blur of brown fur shot out from inside, knocking the lid from her hands. Something small and quick, with two sandwiches in its paws, streaked away in a flash and disappeared into the bushes.

“Hey!” Ionia yelled, leaping to her feet, “that’s my lunch!”

She looked down into the wicker basket, which was, inconceivably, completely empty. Not a scrap of bacon. Not even a solitary apple was left. Their lunch—_her_ lunch—was gone. Pilfered.

Pilferers!

Ionia didn’t hesitate. She bolted into the underbrush after the thieving creature, determined to get their food back. Her mother had made that food! No mangy pilferers were going to rob her of the lunch she’d been dreaming about all morning. The bacon alone was far too delicous to give up without a fight.

In their haste, the pilferers had left a conspicuous trail Ionia was able to easily follow. Scattered leaves and broken twigs clearly marked their escape route, and she scrambled through brambles and brush feeling confident they couldn’t have gotten far loaded down with all that grub.

Or could they?

The chase took Ionia deep into the forest faster than she had expected. Before she knew it, the underbrush became dense and the pilferer’s trail disappeared. She was breathing hard. Her legs and arms were crisscrossed with scritches and scratches from prickles and thorns. Soon the trees were packed so closely together that the light from the afternoon sun barely filtered through.

Ionia didn’t realize how far she had run until she stopped to catch her breath. She looked around and around, suddenly unsure which way was which, and a feeling of panic crept into her chest. The path back to the logging camp had disappeared, swallowed by the forest.

She was lost.

The panic tightened in her chest as she spun in circles, looking, looking, desperate to catch sight of the trail she’d followed into this thicket. She tried calling out for her father, but there was no answer, only the rustling of leaves and unnerving chittering noises from the bushes. Her breathing was fast and uneven. She was lost and she was going to start crying.

But before the first tear could fall, she made a decision.

Ionia closed her eyes.

She steadied her breathing.

She felt her heartbeat, and waited for it to settle down.

She decided not to be lost.
