The unicorn had been watching the girl for seven seasons, though the girl had no way of knowing unicorns could count.

From the shadow of ancient oaks, Stellara observed the small human with her careful movements, her gentle hands gathering eggs from beneath sleepy hens. How peculiar these morning rituals—so different from the forest's eternal rhythms, yet comforting in their quiet certainty. Something about this particular child had drawn Stellara to this cottage at the forest's edge, season after season, watching the girl grow taller, her movements more assured, though still touched with that endearing caution.

There was something about her—something that called across the boundary between worlds. Something familiar that shimmered like a memory from centuries past.

...

Ionia froze, egg warm in her palm, suddenly certain she wasn't alone. The back of her neck prickled, and she turned slowly toward the tree line. Morning mist still clung to the forest edge, but for an instant, she thought she glimpsed something silver—like moonlight that had forgotten to fade with the dawn.

"Ionia!" Her mother's voice broke the moment. "Don't dawdle with those eggs. Your father is packing the cart."

The feeling of being watched faded as Ionia carefully placed the last egg in her basket. Still, she cast one more glance toward the forest before hurrying inside, whispering to herself, "I know you're there," though she couldn't have explained who—or what—she was speaking to.

In the space between heartbeats, the unicorn remembered being human.

Stellara stood at the edge of the ancient forest, her silver coat dappled by the morning sun as it filtered through the leaves. Her dark eyes, fathomless and wise, watched the cottage nestled at the woodland's boundary. How many seasons had she observed the girl who lived there, the child with the cautious hands and the curious heart?

Time flowed differently for Stellara, marked not by the rise and fall of the sun but by the whispered secrets of the trees. Yet something about this girl drew her back, season after season, to witness the small rituals of a life both strange and achingly familiar.

As the girl emerged from the cottage, a basket balanced on her hip, Stellara felt an ancient stirring—a memory of a time when she, too, had walked on two legs and felt the warm weight of a newly laid egg in her palm.

The girl moved through her morning chores with a gentle purposefulness, her dark hair catching the sun as she collected eggs and tended to the sleepy hens. Stellara watched, hardly daring to breathe, as the girl paused, her hand frozen above the last egg.

Slowly, the child turned toward the forest, her eyes searching the dappled shadows. For a heartbeat, their gazes met—the ancient being and the young girl, separated by centuries and species yet connected by a thread as old as time itself.

"Ionia!" A woman's voice shattered the moment, and the girl blinked, the spell broken. "Don't dawdle with those eggs. Your father is packing the cart."

The girl cast one last glance toward the forest before hurrying inside, the basket clutched tight to her chest. But Stellara heard the whispered words carried on the breeze: "I know you're there."

And she was. She always would be, waiting in the space between the girl's world and her own, guarding the secrets that bound them across the ages.

As the cottage door closed, Stellara turned back to the forest, her hooves leaving no mark on the dew-kissed grass. The ancient oaks welcomed her, their leaves whispering stories older than human memory.

For now, she would watch. But the time was coming when the girl would step across the boundary and into the realm of magic and memory. When she would need a guide to light her way through the shadows.

And on that day, Stellara would be waiting, ready to lead her into the heart of the forest and the depths of her own untapped courage.

The hair on Ionia's neck rose as she gathered eggs from beneath the sleepy hens.

She was humming the woodcutter's song to herself—the same tune her father had taught her when she was small—when she felt it: eyes, watching her from the forest edge. Her fingers trembled slightly, the warm egg in her palm suddenly feeling fragile and vulnerable.

She straightened slowly, clutching the basket of eggs to her chest, and turned toward the wall of trees that bordered their small yard. The early morning mist still clung to the forest like a thin blanket, but through it, she glimpsed what looked like a streak of silver weaving between the trunks—like moonlight that had forgotten to fade with the dawn—before it vanished completely.

Her heart fluttered in her chest. Not a deer—it had moved differently. Not a wolf—too silent, too graceful. Certainly not a person. Maybe it was just a trick of the mist and her imagination, but still...

"Ionia!" Her mother's voice broke the strange spell. "Stop dawdling and bring the eggs for breakfast!"

Ionia hesitated, staring at the spot where she'd seen—or thought she'd seen—something. The forest had returned to its morning stillness, birds now singing their dawn songs as if nothing unusual had happened. Yet the feeling of being watched lingered on her skin like a cool breeze.

"Coming!" she called back, drawing a deep breath of the pine-scented morning air before hurrying toward the cottage, the basket clutched close.

Inside, warmth from the cooking fire wrapped around her like a favorite blanket, chasing away the chill that had nothing to do with the morning temperature. Their cottage was small—just three rooms with a nice big fireplace—but it was snug and safe and smelled of baking bread and wood polish. It was Ionia's favorite place in the whole world.

Her mother stood by the stove, skilled hands already working dough for the day's baking. Distracted by thoughts of the silver streak, Ionia handed over the basket of eggs, nearly bumping into the table as she did.

"These are fine eggs," her mother said, examining them with a curious glance at her daughter. "Something troubling you, child?"

Ionia curled her fingers into her palm, still feeling the phantom warmth of the eggs she'd collected. She shook her head, not wanting to sound foolish. "No, just... thinking."

Her mother's expression softened into a smile that crinkled the corners of her eyes. "The eggs are always bigger when you gather them," she said, setting the basket aside. "You have gentle hands."

What her mother didn't say, but what Ionia knew from overhearing village gossip, was that some believed she had a touch of magic about her. Plants seemed to grow better under her care, animals calmed when she stroked them, and yes, hens laid larger eggs when she collected them. Not that Ionia believed such nonsense. She was just careful, that's all—patient in a way other children weren't.

Father entered from outside, bringing with him the scent of pine sap and fresh air. His sturdy frame filled the doorway for a moment before he ducked his head beneath the lintel. Unlike most men from the village, who feared the deep forest, Ionia's father knew the woodland paths like the lines on his own palms. He understood the forest's moods and mysteries in a way that even Ionia, with all her cautious observation, couldn't yet grasp.

As they ate breakfast—two perfectly fried eggs with a thick slice of bread slathered with blackberry jam—her mother mentioned her plans for the day.

"I'm heading to the village market today," she said, wiping a crumb from her mouth. "My wooden bowls should fetch a good price. You're welcome to stay home if you like—you're old enough to take care of yourself for a day."

Ionia's fork paused halfway to her mouth. Staying home alone was tempting—she could draw or read or explore the garden at her leisure. But the memory of those watching eyes made her stomach flutter with equal parts unease and curiosity. What if that silver streak appeared again while she was all alone?

"I think I'll go with Father to the logging camp instead," she said, surprising herself almost as much as her mother.

Her father looked up from his plate, eyebrows raised in genuine astonishment. He had been asking Ionia to join him for months, but she had always declined, preferring the safety of home to the mysteries of the deep forest.

"Are you certain?" he asked, not bothering to hide his pleasure. His eyes crinkled at the corners in exactly the same way her mother's did when she smiled.

Ionia ran her fingers along the smooth wood of the table, feeling the grain beneath her fingertips. "I might see something interesting to draw," she explained, which was true enough, though not the whole truth. She didn't mention the silver mist she'd glimpsed, or the prickling feeling of being watched. Some things were better kept to oneself, at least until you understood them better.

"Well then," her father said, barely containing his excitement, "let's get ready. Hoofbert will be pleased to have your company."

Ionia's mother began packing a wicker basket while Father went to prepare the cart. Into the basket went a loaf of bread, some cheese, two apples, a raw honeycomb, and several strips of their precious smoked bacon wrapped carefully in cheesecloth. Ionia watched her mother's hands, strong but graceful, as they arranged everything just so. Those same hands could turn a shapeless lump of wood into something beautiful—a bowl, a spoon, a tiny carved fox.

"Keep the lid shut tight, Ionia," her mother cautioned, handing over the basket. "Ratty pilferers'll sneak off with your lunch, and that's all the good bacon we've left until summer."

Her mother's face grew serious, the way it always did when talking about the forest. "Remember what I've told you. Stay close to your father. Don't wander."

Ionia knew her mother's warnings about the forest weren't merely tales meant to frighten children. The deep woods were home to creatures both ordinary and extraordinary. Pilferers might seem harmless enough—raccoon-like animals with clever paws and mischievous ways—but the creatures of the Eldwood were different. They were... unnatural... made by ancient magic. They were what kept all but men like her father from venturing into the deep woodland.

The village children sometimes played games at dusk where one would pretend to be lost in the Eldwood, the others prowling, howling, and screeching like Shadowseekers in the growing darkness. Ionia always hated these games, though she pretended not to mind. The idea of being lost in the dark woods, pursued by shadow creatures, made her stomach twist into knots.

"I'll be careful," Ionia promised, meaning it completely. She wasn't the sort of girl who took needless risks. In fact, she'd mapped out exactly where she would sit at the logging camp, how far she would allow herself to wander, and multiple routes back to her father's side if anything frightening appeared.

She slipped away to her small corner of the cottage to pack her drawing tools—a leather-bound journal filled with handmade paper, several charcoal sticks wrapped in cloth, and a small jar of blackberry ink her mother had made last summer. As she flipped through the pages of her sketchbook, she paused at her many drawings of a unicorn—its slender legs, graceful neck, spiraled horn—all imagined from dreams and village tales.

No one had ever actually seen a unicorn, of course. That would be absurd. Yet Ionia's drawings captured something so lifelike that her mother had once asked if she'd somehow seen one for real. "Just in my dreams," Ionia had replied, though sometimes the dreams felt more real than waking life.

Tucked beneath her bed was Goodfriend Foxy, the worn stuffed animal her mother had sewn for her years ago. His right ear was slightly crooked from being resewn after a mishap, and his eyes were simple black buttons that somehow managed to look knowing. After a moment's hesitation, Ionia packed him too. She was far too old for stuffed animals, naturally, but Foxy might want to see the forest. And if her courage faltered, well, he had always been good at keeping secrets.

Outside, her father had finished loading his tools onto the wooden cart. The long toothy saw and heavy axe were secured with care, and old Hoofbert, their gray mule, was already harnessed and waiting patiently. The sight of the gentle mule with his fuzzy ears and soft eyes eased the knot of anxiety in Ionia's chest.

She approached him with half an apple saved from breakfast. "You're a good friend, Hoofbert," she whispered, stroking the mule's velvety nose as he delicately took the treat from her palm. His breath was warm against her skin, smelling of hay and apple. "You'll help keep us safe in the forest today, won't you?"

Hoofbert's ears twitched at the sound of her voice, and Ionia took that as a yes. She threw a threadbare saddle blanket onto his back, earning another ear twitch. The old mule knew there would be extra ear scratches today.

Ionia, her father, and Hoofbert set off down the forest track just as the sun cleared the treetops. They waved goodbye to her mother, who was headed in the opposite direction toward the village, her own cart loaded with finely crafted wooden bowls.

A stream ran down from the forest and meandered south alongside the rutted road, gurgling over smooth stones. As the cart rolled along the muddy track and deeper into the woods, Ionia saw a wrangle of deer nibbling on slender stalks of grass. The clanking and bumping of the cart's wooden wheels made the animals stop their grazing and turn their heads, eyes and ears alert to the travelers.

"Look how they move," her father said quietly, nodding toward the deer. "Always watching, always listening. They know how to read the forest too."

"What do they hear that we don't?" Ionia asked, thinking of the silver streak from this morning.

Her father smiled. "Everything and nothing. They hear danger before it comes. They hear safety when it's present." He placed a warm hand on her shoulder. "Like you, watching and listening before you step."

A rabbit darted across the path in front of Hoofbert and disappeared into a mass of dew-flecked purple flowers. Ionia wondered where it was going in such a hurry, and whether it too had seen something unusual in the forest today.

To distract herself from the growing shadows as they ventured deeper, Ionia began to sing the woodcutter's song—the same one she'd been humming that morning:

_The woodsman treks into the grove,_ _With axe and cart, to work he goes,_ _Mule and meal and lamp for light,_ _He chops the logs with all his might._

Her father joined in with his deep, rumbling voice that Ionia could feel vibrating in her own chest:

_The woodsman knows each tree by heart,_ _When grown up tall he plays his part,_ _Noble wood for house and hearth,_ _He loves the trees but knows their worth._

The two of them sang their song as loudly as they pleased, sometimes making up new verses or changing the words to silly rhymes that made Ionia giggle despite her nervousness. Somehow, singing with her father made the forest seem less mysterious, more welcoming.

Yet Ionia noticed how the forest seemed to listen to their singing—how the leaves would sometimes shake without any wind, as if the trees were laughing at their made-up verses. She wondered if trees could really hear, if they remembered the songs sung beneath their branches over years and years.

As they traveled deeper, Ionia began to notice wooden totems carved with faces resembling the Green Man from village tales. They were weathered and moss-covered, but their hollow eyes seemed to follow the cart as it passed. She had always found these carvings unsettling, though she couldn't say exactly why. Perhaps it was the way they seemed almost alive, as if the wood itself might speak at any moment.

"Father," she said, pointing to a particularly large carving whose features were nearly obscured by emerald moss, "what are those for?"

Her father glanced at the totem. "Boundary markers, from the old days," he answered simply. "Left by woodcutters who came before."

"Do they... watch us?" Ionia asked, trying to keep her voice steady while her fingers found the outline of Goodfriend Foxy hidden in her satchel.

"Only to remember," her father replied, which didn't reassure her at all. What did the forest need to remember about them? And why?

They continued singing their woodcutter's song as they traveled deeper into the forest, their voices echoing among ancient trees that grew taller and more imposing with every mile. Ionia couldn't shake the feeling that they were being observed—not just by the carved faces, but by the forest itself.

They arrived at the logging camp by mid-morning. It was little more than a clearing where several large trees had been felled, their stumps dotting the ground like giant's teeth. Sawdust carpeted the forest floor in a golden blanket that sparkled in the dappled sunlight. The scent of fresh-cut wood and pine resin hung in the air, familiar from her father's clothes each evening when he returned home.

Father unhitched Hoofbert and secured the lunch basket on a sturdy stump. "Now then," he said, checking the edge of his axe blade one final time, "I'll be working on that big oak at the edge of the clearing. Stay where I can see you, and remember what your mother said about the basket!"

Ionia nodded solemnly, already reaching for her sketchbook, eager to capture the strange flowers she'd spotted growing near the edge of the clearing. Their petals seemed to shimmer in the sunlight, changing from pale blue to lavender depending on how she tilted her head.

As she settled onto a smooth stump, opening her sketchbook to a fresh page, Ionia glanced back toward the forest's edge. For just a moment, she thought she saw that same silver shimmer from this morning, weaving between distant trees. Her heart skipped a beat, but when she blinked, it was gone.

She couldn't know then that this ordinary morning was about to become the most extraordinary day of her life.
