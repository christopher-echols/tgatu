## At the Logging Camp

- Ionia sits at the logging camp, drawing in her sketchbook while Father (Rowan) works
- Pilferers emerge from the underbrush, initially fascinating Ionia with their behavior
- Pilferers perform coordinated diversion to steal lunch basket
- Ionia calls out to Father, but axe rhythm drowns out her voice
- Ionia makes impulsive decision to follow the pilferers to retrieve the basket

## Into the Woods

- Ionia follows pilferers deeper into unfamiliar territory
- She moves farther from camp than she's ever been, getting progressively more disoriented
- Pilferers lead her toward the boundary stream (though she doesn't realize its significance)
- Father continues working, unaware Ionia has left the camp

## The Stream Embankment

- Ionia slips down muddy embankment into the stream bed
- Pilferers peer down at her with seeming amusement before vanishing
- Ionia realizes she's lost, wet, and disoriented, beginning to panic
- The stream is actually the unmarked boundary between regular forest and Eldwood
- Ionia has not crossed the stream, so remains safe from transformation magic

## The Unicorn Appears

- Stellara (in unicorn form) senses Ionia's distress near the boundary
- Appears across the stream, revealing herself gradually to avoid frightening the child
- Makes deliberate eye contact, establishing silent communication
- Steps onto water's surface, demonstrating magical nature
- Begins walking upstream, clearly inviting Ionia to follow

## The Return Journey

- Ionia follows Stellara along the stream rather than crossing it
- This choice (though Ionia doesn't realize it) keeps her safely on the non-Eldwood side
- Stellara leads Ionia back toward the logging camp using the stream as a guide
- The journey creates no trackable trail since they walk in the water
- Back at camp, Stellara lingers briefly as Ionia tries to thank her

## At the Camp (Later)

- Father notices Ionia's absence during a work break
- Finds her sketchbook abandoned, becomes alarmed
- Follows obvious trail of footprints into the woods
- Tracks lead to the embankment where Ionia slipped
- Finds no continuing trail beyond the stream (as Ionia followed the unicorn in the water)

## The Fateful Crossing

- Father assumes Ionia crossed the stream and continued straight ahead
- Knowing the stream is the Eldwood boundary, he makes the desperate decision to cross
- Steps across boundary despite lifelong adherence to forest rules
- Immediately begins experiencing disorientation as transformation magic takes effect
- Calls for Ionia repeatedly, voice becoming more desperate

## Parallel Actions

- Stellara senses boundary violation at the moment she's departing from Ionia
- Realizes Rowan has crossed while she was drawn away from her guardian post
- Races back to boundary crossing point, shifting to full unicorn speed
- Father pushes deeper into Eldwood, increasingly confused but determined to find Ionia
- Valduar'sha (shadow creatures) detect the boundary crossing and begin to converge

## The Conflict in the Eldwood

- Stellara locates Rowan, already surrounded by shadow creatures
- Shadow creatures are herding him deeper into the Eldwood as per Wyrnox's law
- Stellara attempts to drive away shadows using her light and presence
- Rowan, already affected by transformation magic, doesn't recognize the unicorn's attempts to help
- Stellara creates protective light around him that temporarily slows memory-loss
- Battle ensues between unicorn's protective magic and shadow creatures' herding

## The Second Boundary Breach

- Ionia, having discovered her father missing, follows his obvious tracks to the stream
- Stellara, while fighting to protect Rowan, senses Ionia approaching the boundary
- Forced to make immediate choice: continue fighting for Rowan or save Ionia from crossing
- Knows children transform much faster than adults under Eldwood magic
- Makes heartbreaking decision to abandon Rowan temporarily to prevent Ionia's crossing

## The Race and Hidden Transformation

- Stellara sprints back to the boundary, pushing unicorn form to its limits
- Reaches stream just as Ionia is about to step across
- Quickly retreats behind dense foliage, out of Ionia's sight
- Transforms to human form hidden from view
- Unicorn silently vanishes while Maren emerges from a different location
- The connection between unicorn and woodswoman remains secret

## The Unexpected Appearance

- Ionia stands at stream's edge, looking for her father's tracks
- Maren suddenly emerges from the trees, seeming to appear from nowhere
- Calls out urgently: "Go no further!" with hands outstretched to block Ionia's path
- Appears as if she had been tracking Ionia through the forest
- Nothing visibly connects her to the unicorn Ionia met earlier
- Creates impression of a mysterious forest dweller who happened upon Ionia at a critical moment

## The Aftermath

- Ionia is startled by the sudden appearance of this unknown woman
- Maren quickly explains the danger of crossing the boundary
- Reveals that Rowan has already crossed and begun transforming
- Explains the time-sensitive nature of memory loss in the Eldwood
- Offers to help find a way to rescue Rowan before transformation becomes permanent
- This moment establishes their partnership for the remainder of the story
- Neither Ionia nor the reader has reason to connect Maren to the unicorn
