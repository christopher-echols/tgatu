"Father!" Ionia called out, but the steady rhythm of his axe drowned her voice. The pilferers were already disappearing into the underbrush, her precious lunch basket bouncing between them as they passed it back and forth like some kind of game.

She hesitated only a moment. That basket contained the last of their summer bacon! Without thinking through what she was doing, Ionia darted after them into the woods.

The pilferers were quick, but their short legs meant they had to work harder to navigate through the forest debris. She could just make out the wicker basket bobbing between them as they took turns carrying it, their tails held high as they ran. Despite her frustration, Ionia couldn't help but admire their cleverness.

She was so focused on following them that she didn't notice how the ground was sloping away beneath her feet, or how the sound of running water was growing louder with each step. The pilferers darted between two mossy logs, and Ionia rushed forward to follow—but the earth suddenly crumbled beneath her feet.

With a startled cry, she slid down the steep embankment, loose dirt and pebbles cascading with her. She landed with a splash in the shallow stream below, soaking her dress up to her waist. Looking up, she saw the pilferers peering down at her from the top of the bank, their bright eyes glinting with what looked almost like satisfaction. Then they scampered away, leaving her alone.

Ionia sat in the cool water, her cheeks burning with shame. She had done exactly what her father had warned her never to do—wandered too far from the camp, let herself get lost in these ancient woods. What would he think of her? She needed to get back, but which way was the camp? The embankment rose steep and crumbling on both sides of the stream, and everything looked different from down here in the water.

That's when she saw it—a flash of silver through the trees on the opposite bank.

Ionia caught her breath as a creature stepped out from behind a massive oak tree. It moved with impossible grace, each step deliberate and light, as it approached the water's edge. It was like a horse, but unlike any horse she had ever seen. Its coat shimmered like moonlight on snow, and from its forehead spiraled a single horn that seemed to gather all the scattered rays of sunlight filtering through the canopy above.

Where its hooves touched the ground, tiny white flowers bloomed in its footsteps, as if spring itself followed in its wake. The creature—the unicorn, she realized with a surge of wonder—bent its elegant neck and drank from the stream. In the water's surface, its reflection glowed like liquid starlight, turning the stream to silver where it touched.

When it raised its head again, its eyes met Ionia's. They were deep and knowing, filled with an ancient wisdom that made her feel both very small and strangely safe. Then, to her amazement, the unicorn stepped out onto—not into—the water. It stood upon the surface as if it were solid ground, sending only the faintest ripples spreading out from beneath its hooves.

The unicorn turned its head upstream and took a step, then looked back at Ionia expectantly. Though no words were spoken, she understood perfectly what it wanted her to do. Still sitting in the shallow water, she watched as the magical creature began walking upstream, its hooves barely disturbing the water's surface.

Ionia pushed herself to her feet, her soaked dress dripping. The stream barely reached her calves here, and the current wasn't strong. Looking once more at the steep embankment where she had fallen, then back at the retreating form of the unicorn, she made her choice. She began to walk through the water, following the magnificent creature upstream.
