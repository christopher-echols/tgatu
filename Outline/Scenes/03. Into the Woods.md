*Ionia and Father travel to the logging camp, singing, observing wildlife and making plans for the day.*

As they journey deeper into the forest, Father and Ionia sing their traditional woodcutter's song together, their voices echoing through the morning air. The forest seems to respond to their presence - deer pause their grazing to watch them pass, a rabbit darts across their path, and Father takes each moment as an opportunity to teach Ionia about the woodland's ways. He shows her how to read the forest's signs, from the moss growing thicker on the north side of trees to the meaning behind different bird calls, demonstrating his deep connection to and respect for the natural world.

The journey to the logging camp serves as a vital introduction to the forest as both a physical and magical space. As the cart bumps along the rutted track, the familiar world of the cottage gradually gives way to the deeper woodland. The morning light filters through the canopy, creating shifting patterns that transform the ordinary forest into something that feels increasingly mysterious and alive.

Father uses this time to share his woodland wisdom with Ionia. His teachings go beyond practical knowledge - while he shows her how to spot deer tracks in the soft earth and recognize birds by their songs, he's also introducing her to a way of seeing the forest as a living entity that communicates through signs and symbols. His oft-repeated phrase about every creature having "its place" and "a part to play" reveals his philosophy about the interconnected nature of the woodland world.

The woodcutter's song they share is more than just a way to pass the time - it's a tradition that connects them to generations of forest workers who have maintained a respectful relationship with the woods. Through their playful modifications of the lyrics and the way the forest seems to listen to their singing - leaves sometimes shaking without wind, as if the trees are laughing at their silly rhymes - we see how Father has found a way to make the potentially frightening forest feel like home to Ionia.

This scene also begins to reveal the boundary between the normal forest and the magical one. As they travel further in, subtle changes in the environment hint at the deeper magic that awaits - the way shadows move differently here, how sounds carry strangely through the trees, the sense that they're being watched by unseen eyes. Yet Father's calm presence and practical knowledge help Ionia navigate these changes, showing her how to balance healthy respect for the forest's power with the confidence needed to work within it.
