*Ionia and Father arrive at his logging camp in the forest, unload the cart, and he treks off to work.*

[[Ionia]], [[Father]], [[Hoofbert]]

---

On Ionia's first journey this far into the forest, she and Father arrive at his logging camp where the normal woods begin to give way to more mysterious terrain. As Father sets up his work area, he seizes this long-awaited opportunity to share his beloved wilderness with his daughter, pointing out interesting plants and wildlife for her to sketch while establishing safe boundaries for her exploration. Though excited to finally see this deeper part of the forest, Ionia stays close to Hoofbert at first, her natural curiosity warring with her ingrained caution about these unfamiliar woods.

The logging camp scene represents a crucial milestone in both Ionia's development and her relationship with her father. After years of gentle encouragement, Rowan has finally convinced his daughter to accompany him this far into the forest, and his actions reveal his deep desire to make this first visit special. The clearing, dotted with thick stumps like giant's teeth and carpeted with golden sawdust, represents not just his workplace but a chance to share his world with his daughter.

This scene establishes the delicate balance between Rowan's two roles - protective father and forest mentor. As he methodically prepares his tools, each action demonstrates both practical expertise and deeper woodland wisdom. But today, his usual routine takes on new significance as he intersperses his work with carefully chosen moments of instruction, pointing out interesting plants for Ionia's sketchbook and explaining which birds make which calls. His directions about staying within sight carry both parental protection and woodland wisdom - he knows that even in familiar parts of the forest, one must maintain awareness of one's surroundings.

For Ionia, the logging camp marks the threshold between the forest she knows and the deeper mysteries she's only heard about in stories. Her mixed emotions manifest in small but telling ways - her excitement when spotting a new flower to draw, but also how she positions herself near Hoofbert's reassuring presence. Though she's drawn to explore this new environment, her ingrained caution keeps her close to familiar anchors at first. Through her eyes, we see how the clearing exists in a liminal space, where the normal forest begins to take on more mysterious qualities.

The scene also deepens our understanding of the story's physical and metaphysical geography. While setting up his work area, Father explains about the Eldwood's unmarked boundary that lies somewhere beyond the clearing. Unlike the villagers' fearful warnings, his explanation comes from generations of family knowledge about maintaining harmony with the forest's magic. Through his matter-of-fact discussion of which trees can be harvested and which must be left untouched, we see how his family has learned to work within the forest's rules rather than fighting against them.
