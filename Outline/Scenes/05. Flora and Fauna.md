*Ionia sets the lunch basket safely aside, then explores the camp, sketching flowers and insects.*

[[Ionia]], [[Hoofbert]]

After carefully placing the lunch basket on a sturdy stump near Hoofbert, Ionia begins to explore the clearing around her father's work area. The steady rhythm of his axe provides a comforting backdrop as she discovers the first signs of spring awakening in the forest - from early blooming primroses and wood anemones to peculiar silvery-stemmed ferns that seem to unfurl in the morning light. She settles down to sketch a cluster of unusual bell-shaped flowers growing from the damp earth, occasionally glancing up to locate her father by the sound of his methodical chopping.

The flora and fauna scene showcases the forest's emergence from winter, where ordinary woodland begins to reveal its magical qualities. The ground, still soft from weeks of melting snow, supports the first wave of spring growth. Common early bloomers that Ionia recognizes - patches of wood sorrel, purple celandines, and the first tentative bluebell shoots - mingle with more mysterious vegetation. She spots clusters of "moonmist ferns" whose silvery fronds seem to catch and hold the morning light, and delicate "stillbells" whose crystalline flowers hover just above the damp earth, untouched by the morning's lingering chill.

The steady rhythm of her father's axe becomes an anchor point for Ionia's exploration. Each time she hears its familiar sound, she feels more confident about venturing a little further into the ring of vegetation around the clearing. Near a patch of emerging daffodils, she discovers a family of red squirrels gathering the last of winter's hazelnuts, but notices how their fur seems to shimmer with a copper-like gleam in the early morning light. A returning thrush's song mingles with what her father calls a "dawn piper," a small brown bird whose melody seems to make the morning dew sparkle and dance.

Settling down with her sketchbook, Ionia chooses to draw a cluster of flowers she's never seen before - delicate blooms growing where a stream of snowmelt has carved a tiny channel, their petals the color of morning mist. As she sketches, she observes how early bumblebees seem especially drawn to these flowers, their buzzing creating tiny rainbow refractions in the dew-like patterns on the petals. She adds these details to her drawing, trying to capture both the practical and magical aspects of her discovery.

Throughout her exploration, the constant sound of her father's work provides a reassuring rhythm to her adventure. Each strike of the axe echoes through the spring-damp air, reminding her that she's safe to investigate these mysterious plants and creatures. The morning dew is still heavy on the vegetation, but sunlight warming the clearing promises a mild spring day ahead. This security allows her to focus on the delicate work of sketching, only occasionally glancing up to spot her father's familiar figure through the awakening trees.
