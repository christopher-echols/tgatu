*Cornered by shadows in an ancient grove, Ionia faces the mighty Woodland Elder itself.*

[[Ionia]], [[Shadowhounds]], [[Eldwys]]

---

Stumbling into a grove of impossibly ancient trees, Ionia finds herself trapped as the shadows press in, expectant and triumphant. But before they can claim their victory, the very air changes as an immense presence makes itself known through every tree, every leaf, every breath of wind. The Woodland Elder, speaking through all the trees at once, recognizes in this child something it has seen only once before: the same desperate love that once moved it to grant mercy to another who dared to enter its realm seeking one they'd lost.
