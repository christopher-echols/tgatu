*Though her father entered uninvited, the Elder acknowledges that love once moved it to mercy.*

[[Ionia]], [[Eldwys]]

---

The Elder reveals the price of entering its realm uninvited: Ionia's father's memories are already beginning to fade like morning mist. But then the voices speak of another who once entered these woods seeking someone lost to the forest's magic - one whose love moved the Elder to mercy. Though they neither grant nor deny Ionia permission to enter the Eldwood, the voices acknowledge that she has already chosen her path. The Elder's presence fades, leaving Ionia to face whatever lies ahead with the knowledge that love once before overcame the forest's ancient law.
