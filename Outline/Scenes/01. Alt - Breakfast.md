# Chapter One: A Map of Stones

The silver blur vanished behind the oak tree before Ionia could properly see it.

"Come back," she whispered, pressing her nose against the cold window glass. Fog bloomed from her breath, obscuring her view of the forest edge. Three mornings now she'd spotted the creature—too graceful for a deer, too silvery for a wolf. If only she could draw it in her journal.

With a small sigh, Ionia turned from the window and knelt on her bedroom floor where thirteen special stones waited. Today of all days, she needed their protection. Father was taking her to the logging camp—deep in the Great Northwood where the forest kept its secrets.

"Courage," she whispered, placing a smooth gray pebble with a white streak at the northernmost point of her circle. "Wisdom." A speckled amber stone went east. "Remembering." A blue-tinted river stone with tiny fossils took the southern position. "Protection." The black stone with a hole through its center completed the western point.

Ionia arranged the remaining nine stones inside the circle with careful attention. Her mother called it her "stone map," and while she never admitted it aloud, that's exactly what it was—a map to help navigate the day ahead.

"Ionia!" Her father's voice boomed up the stairs. "The forest waits for no one, Little Bird!"

Her stomach tightened as she touched each stone in turn. "Keep me safe, keep me brave, keep me knowing, keep me found," she murmured, then gathered them into her leather pouch, tying it securely to her belt.

She grabbed her canvas shoulder bag, packed with her treasures: her handmade sketchbook filled with forest drawings, charcoal pencils wrapped in waxed cloth, a roll of clean cotton bandages, and a small tin of beeswax salve. Last night, she'd secretly added something her mother would definitely not approve of—a tiny glass jar for collecting interesting specimens.

Downstairs, the familiar world of home greeted her. Mother's woodworking tools hung on the wall, Father's boots stood by the door, and the scent of sizzling bacon made her stomach rumble.

"There's my explorer," Father said with a warm smile. His large hands cupped a steaming mug that made Ionia think of how small her own hands looked when holding the same cup.

Mother turned from the stove, spatula in hand. "Did you pack your—"

"Bandages, salve, and extra socks," Ionia said, patting her bag. "And I remembered all my special stones."

Father's laugh filled the room. "The forest isn't as dangerous as all that, Little Bird."

"But it's not our garden either," Mother countered, sliding a plate before Ionia: two perfect bacon strips atop thick bread slathered with blackberry jam. "The deep woods have rules we don't always understand."

Ionia bit into her breakfast, trying to squash the butterflies in her stomach. "Do you think we might see any... you know... magical creatures?" she asked between bites, trying to sound casual.

Her parents exchanged that look adults thought children couldn't interpret.

"The forest keeps its mysteries for those patient enough to look properly," Father replied, his eyes crinkling at the corners.

"And some mysteries are best admired from a safe distance," Mother added, packing their lunch basket: bacon wrapped in cheesecloth, dark bread, yellow cheese, apples, honeycomb, and a waterskin of mint-sweetened water.

"Remember what I told you about the pilferers?" Mother asked, securing the basket's lid with a knot.

"They're clever thieves who work together," Ionia said. "And they especially like food."

Father nodded. "Mischievous little creatures, but mostly harmless."

"Tell that to Miller's son who followed them last spring and was lost until nightfall," Mother said, her voice taking on the worried edge it got whenever they discussed the deep forest.

Ionia finished her breakfast and wiped away the last trace of jam with her finger. Part of her wanted to stay home with her drawings and stones, but another part—the part that watched for silver creatures at dawn—trembled with excitement.

Outside, the morning air was crisp against her cheeks. Ionia helped her father load his tools onto the wooden cart: the long-toothed saw that reminded her of dragon's teeth, and the heavy axe with its gleaming blade.

Hoofbert, their gray mule, was already harnessed to the cart, his ears twitching with what Ionia recognized as friendly interest.

"Good morning, wise one," she said softly, stroking his velvety nose. "You'll help keep us safe today, won't you?"

She pulled half an apple from her pocket and offered it on her flat palm. Hoofbert's soft lips tickled as he took the treat, making her giggle.

"That mule understands you better than most people," Father observed, securing the lunch basket in the cart.

"We're friends," Ionia said simply. "He listens to my secrets."

Mother emerged from the cottage, her hands dusted with wood shavings. She embraced Ionia tightly, then held her at arm's length, eyes full of motherly concern.

"Listen to your father," she said firmly. "Stay where he can see you. And the basket—"

"Keep the lid shut tight so the pilferers don't steal our lunch," Ionia finished. "I'll be careful, Mother. I promise."

Mother's smile was gentle but worried. "And the most important rule?"

Ionia nodded solemnly. "Stay far from the Eldwood, where the trees grow strange and the shadows move oddly."

With Father's help, Ionia climbed onto Hoofbert's back, settling herself on the threadbare blanket. The world looked different from this height—bigger, full of possibilities that both frightened and thrilled her.

"I expect a full report on everything you see," Mother said, tucking a stray lock of hair behind Ionia's ear.

"I'll draw it all," Ionia promised, patting her sketchbook. She hesitated, then added, "Mother, I've seen something at the forest edge. Three mornings now. Something silver that moves like... like nothing I've ever seen before."

Mother's expression flickered, and she glanced at Father with a question in her eyes.

Father took Hoofbert's lead, his large hand making the leather strap look small. "The forest shares its wonders with those who look with the right eyes," he said in that mysterious way of his.

As they moved down the path toward the stream, Ionia turned to wave at Mother, who stood in the doorway, one hand raised in farewell, the other pressed against her heart—a gesture Ionia had drawn many times in her journal.

The moment they rounded the bend where the cottage disappeared from view, Ionia pulled out her sketchbook and flipped past detailed drawings of beetles, flowers, and birds. She turned to a fresh page and quickly outlined the path ahead.

"Father," she began, as Hoofbert's steady pace rocked her gently, "do you believe in unicorns? Truly believe, I mean."

Father was quiet for a moment. "I believe the forest holds wonders we don't fully understand," he finally said. "And that an open heart often sees more than a doubtful one."

Ionia considered this as she patted her stone pouch. "That's why I brought Protection today. The black stone with the hole."

"Good thinking," Father said, in a tone that told her he respected her preparations.

As they followed the path deeper into the Northwood, Ionia felt the forest changing around them. The trees grew taller, their branches creating a living canopy overhead. Sunlight filtered through in dappled patterns that Ionia wished she could capture in her drawings. Birds called from above, each song distinct and beautiful.

Then—a flash of silver between distant trees stopped her breath. The same gleam she'd spotted from her window, but larger now, more defined.

"Father!" she gasped, pointing. "The silver creature!"

But when Father turned to look, whatever had caught Ionia's eye was gone, leaving only swaying branches in its wake.

"Perhaps it's showing itself to you for a reason," Father said thoughtfully. "The forest chooses its witnesses carefully."

Ionia's heart raced. Could it be? The creature from the village children's stories? The one with a spiral horn that glowed like starlight?

She reached for her courage stone, fingers finding it within the pouch. For the first time since breakfast, her nervousness transformed into something else—a tingling anticipation that spread from her fingers to her toes.

Today she would discover something magical. She felt it with certainty.

Little did she know just how magical—and dangerous—the day would become.
