*Ionia and her father load the log cart, hitch up Hoofbert, wave goodbye and set off.*

[[Ionia]], [[Father]], [[Hoofbert]]

---

Ionia and her father prepare for their journey into the forest, methodically loading his tools onto the wooden cart while Hoofbert, their old gray mule, waits patiently. The scene reveals the deep bond between Ionia and the gentle mule as she shares her breakfast apple with him and whispers her hopes for their day's adventure. Her mother watches from the doorway of their cottage, her expression a mixture of pride and concern, as her husband and daughter ready themselves for their journey into the mysterious woodland.

The loading of the cart serves as a crucial transition between the safety of home and the adventure that awaits in the forest. Father's careful attention to his tools - the heavy axe, the long toothy saw, the various wedges and mallets - demonstrates both his expertise and the serious nature of his work. The way he arranges each item reveals his methodical nature and deep respect for his craft, traits that have allowed him to work safely in the forest for so many years.

The scene deepens our understanding of Hoofbert's role in the family. More than just a working animal, the old gray mule represents a bridge between the domestic and forest worlds. His steady presence has been a constant in Ionia's life, and their interaction - her sharing the apple, his gentle nuzzling - shows how she finds comfort in his familiar friendship when facing the uncertainty of the forest. Through Ionia's whispered confidences to Hoofbert, we learn more about her anxieties about the journey ahead and her trust in the mule's protective presence.

Mother's role in this scene is subtle but significant. Though she remains in the doorway of their cottage, her presence is felt in the careful packing of the lunch basket, the extra wool scarf she insists Ionia take "just in case," and the way she watches them prepare to leave. Her farewell reveals the complex emotions of a village woman who has learned to trust her husband's forest wisdom while never fully shedding her own childhood fears about the woodland.

The scene also establishes important practical details about the family's way of life. The sturdy but well-worn cart, the carefully maintained tools, and the ancient rutted track that leads from their cottage into the forest all speak to the sustainable relationship Father maintains with the woodland. His patient instruction to Ionia about how to properly secure the tools shows how he's gradually teaching her to understand and respect both his work and the forest itself.
