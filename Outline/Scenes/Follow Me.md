*The unicorn leads Ionia upstream, through the winding wood, back to the logging camp.*

[[Ionia]], [[Unicorn]]

---

The unicorn leads Ionia along the stream, away from the dangerous boundary of the Eldwood, walking not *in* but *on* the water itself. The magical creature shows Ionia many woodland wonders as it wordlessly invites the girl to experience the beauty of this place she has feared her whole life. In time, they make their way back to the safety of the logging camp.
