[[Ionia]], [[Mother]]

---

Ionia wakes up hungry for bacon on the morning she's to accompany her father into the forest. In the kitchen, her mother playfully teases her with an apple before revealing the proper breakfast she's prepared, then begins packing a special lunch basket for their journey. As she fills the basket with bread, cheese, and precious bacon, Ionia's mother warns her about the forest's pilferers who might try to steal their lunch, revealing both her practical knowledge and deeper anxieties about the magical woodland where her husband works. The scene establishes the warm family dynamic while foreshadowing the adventure to come, as Ionia's excitement about the day ahead mingles with the slight nervousness she always feels about entering the forest.

The opening scene establishes Ionia's home life and sets up key elements that will drive the story forward. The scene begins with Ionia waking up in her small but cozy bedroom in the cottage her parents built. Though initially reluctant to leave her warm bed, she's motivated by the smell of cooking bacon wafting from the kitchen. This detail serves both to characterize the humble but loving household and to establish the importance of the bacon that will later be stolen.

The scene explores the relationship between Ionia and her mother through their morning routine. Clara, her mother, displays both practical capability and underlying anxiety about the forest. She efficiently prepares both breakfast and the lunch basket while pepper ing her conversation with warnings about forest creatures. The interaction reveals Clara's internal conflict - she wants Ionia to be strong and independent like her father, but can't fully suppress her village-bred fears about the woodland.

The packing of the lunch basket becomes a central focus, allowing natural exposition about the family's economic situation (the bacon being precious and meant to last until summer) and introducing the concept of pilferers. Clara's warning about keeping the basket tightly closed foreshadows the coming conflict while providing context about the forest's magical inhabitants.

The scene also establishes Ionia's character through her interactions with her mother and her preparations for the day. Her dress, boots, and the contents of her pack (drawing materials, bandages, etc.) show her practical nature while hinting at her artistic sensitivity. Her response to her mother's warnings reveals her complex relationship with the forest - she's both drawn to and frightened by its mysteries.

Through dialogue and internal reflection, we learn about the village's relationship with the forest. The contrast between village superstitions and her father's deeper understanding of the woods is established. This tension is personified in Clara, who has learned to trust her husband's woodland wisdom but can't entirely shed her childhood fears.

The scene ends with Ionia fully dressed and equipped for her journey, the precious lunch basket packed and ready. Her mounting excitement about spending the day with her father is tempered by the slight nervousness she always feels about entering the forest, creating tension that will build throughout the coming scenes.
