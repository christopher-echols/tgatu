*The Elder speaks through every tree, questioning whether love or fear has drawn Ionia here.*

[[Ionia]], [[Eldwys]]

---

Through every tree in the grove, the Elder's consciousness emerges - not as a single voice but as many, each slightly different yet part of the same ancient awareness. As Ionia explains her presence, the voices harmonize and diverge, examining her motives. The Elder sees through surface reasons to the deeper truth: that both love and fear have guided her path to this moment. Each voice adds its own perspective, creating a symphony of ancient wisdom that makes Ionia realize she stands before something as vast as the forest itself.
