*Mustering her courage, Ionia decides not to give up, and at that moment, the unicorn emerges.*

[[Ionia]], [[Unicorn]]

At her lowest moment, Ionia decides she will not give up. She will not be lost. She will find her way back to the camp and prove to herself that she isn't helpless. As she lifts her head from her hands and opens her eyes, she sees something that makes her think she must be dreaming: a unicorn.
