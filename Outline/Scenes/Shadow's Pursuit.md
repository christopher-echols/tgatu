==⚠️ DISASTER ⚠️==
*Terrified, Ionia flees deeper into the woods, pursued by living shadows.*

[[Ionia]], [[Shadowhounds]]

---

The shadows herd Ionia through the darkening forest like wolves driving prey, cutting off every escape path except the one leading further in. Their movements become more aggressive, more coordinated, working together to push another human intruder toward the heart of the Eldwood's power. Exhausted and terrified, she realizes they're forcing her toward judgment, just as they've done with every human who has threatened their realm since the first trees took root.
