- They arrive at the logging camp and hitch Hoofbert to an old post
- Father takes Ionia to a weather-worn shrine to leave an offering
- He speaks an oath of thanks to [[The Hawthorne Legacy - Guardians of the Boundary#Origins of the Covenant (circa 1380-1420)|The Covenant]] for the privilege of harvesting this timber 
- Father reminds Ionia about their proximity to the Eldwood, and not to stray too far

- She says that she feels safest when she can see him
- He says that as long as she can hear the sound of his axe, she'll know he's right here
- Father kisses her head and tells her to go find some magical creatures to sketch
- Ionia watches him go, waiting until the steady rhythm of his axe gives her comfort to explore
- Ionia opens her sketchbook, flipping past pages of unicorn drawings to find a blank page
- She wanders a bit until she notices a flower she's never seen before
- She sits down, cross-legged and instinctively draws a circle around herself in the dirt
- She takes Goodfriend Foxy from her bag and props him up beside her
- Ionia meticulously draws the fascinating flower, which has a strangely magical quality about it


- A small creature emerges and begins collecting red berries, captivating Ionia
- Ionia impulsively leaves her circle and moves behind a stump for a closer look
- She realizes this must be one of the [[Pilferers]] her mother had long warned her about
- Safely behind the stump, unseen by the creature, Ionia starts sketching the animal
- A second pilferer arrives and they work together, stuffing berries into their marsupial pouches
- Ionia keeps sketching, filling her page, captivated by this display of collaboration
- As the pair pick the last of the berries, a third, larger pilferer approaches from behind
- The larger pilferer springs on one of the first, pinning it to the ground
- This intruder begins snatching berries from the victim's pouch, stuffing his own
- The bystander begins chittering and hissing at the bully
- Ionia, who has become fully engrossed in this drama stands up and shouts at the intruder
- The three pilferers all spring to attention, turning to face the human and crouching low

- Realizing she's been had, she shouts at the lunch thieves and runs toward the cart
- By the time she gets there, the nimble pilferers are disappearing into the underbrush
- Ionia stammers, and clenches her fists, feeling her cheeks reddening
- She shouts for her father
- Hoofbert raises his head from the clover he's munching
- Father is far enough away, chopping steadily, that her shouts don't reach him
- Ionia starts to panic, thinking about Mother's warning and how she has now lost the basket
- She thinks about running to Father for help, but that would take too long
- Feeling foolish for having been tricked and failing to heed Mother's warnings, Ionia acts
- She decides the thieves can't have gotten far, and she's much bigger and faster than they are
- Knowing she has to move fast, she sets off at a sprint, leaving her sketchbook and Foxy





- Ionia slips down a muddy embankment into a stream bed, becoming separated from familiar territory.
- The pilferers peer down at Ionia from the embankment before vanishing into the forest shadows.
- Soaked and mud-covered, Ionia notices the nearby shadows lengthening oddly toward her, as if reaching out.
- [Watcher] Silver hooves step delicately through forest shadows that recoil from their light.
- A silver light appears and the shadows retreat as a unicorn materializes standing in the stream.
- The unicorn steps onto the water's surface and begins traveling upstream, indicating Ionia should follow.
- Ionia follows the unicorn along the stream, seeing wonders of the forest she never imagined existed.
- The unicorn guides Ionia back to the logging camp but disappears like morning mist when she tries to thank it.
- Ionia finds the camp eerily silent with no sign of Father except his abandoned axe lying among the trees.
- She runs to Hoofbert, still tethered where they left him, and finds comfort in stroking his familiar nose.
- Ionia notices her father's bootprints leading toward the Eldwood boundary and realizes he went searching for her.
- She faces a difficult choice – stay with Hoofbert as her father always taught her to do if lost, or follow his tracks.
- After an anguished moment of indecision, Ionia unties Hoofbert and tells him to go home to Mother if she doesn't return quickly.
- Following her father's bootprints, Ionia pushes deeper into increasingly ancient and watchful woods.
- The trail begins to fade as if the forest itself is erasing it, leaving Ionia truly lost.
- A woman's voice rings out: "Go no further," as Maren the woodswoman drops lightly from a nearby tree.
- Maren explains that Ionia's father has crossed into the Eldwood and is slowly losing his memories.
- Maren reveals that Wyrnox, an ancient spirit of the forest, created the transformation law after humans began destroying the trees.
- As darkness falls on Ionia's first night in the magical forest, shadow creatures gather at the edges of her vision.
- Maren explains these are Wyrnox's servants, enforcing his will and driving trespassers deeper into the forest.
- Maren leads Ionia to her cottage that seems to grow from the forest itself.
- [Watcher's View] Moonlight catches on tears as unseen eyes observe the child's fear and sorrow from the darkness.
- Over dinner, Maren explains that time flows differently in the Eldwood – days here might be hours in the outside world.
- A clatter from Maren's bedside table interrupts their conversation - something has knocked over a small jar.
- They turn to see a pilferer frozen in surprise, clutching Maren's silver thimble in one paw and several pages from Ionia's sketchbook in the other.
- The pilferer drops the papers and darts toward an open window but gets tangled in the curtain, chittering in distress.
- Maren calmly frees the creature while Ionia gasps with joy at seeing pages from her precious sketchbook.
- The pages include several of Ionia's unicorn drawings, which Maren studies with surprised recognition.
- The pilferer crouches nervously, ears flattened, as Ionia slowly offers it berries from Maren's table.
- After cautious sniffing, the creature accepts the berries while still clinging to the thimble, unwilling to give up its treasure.

- Thimble chittering grows excited when Ionia shows him the unicorn drawings, pointing repeatedly toward the forest.
- Maren asks if there might be more pages, and Thimble nods vigorously, gesturing that he knows where to find them.
- That night, Ionia catches Thimble arranging her recovered pages carefully on the floor, seeming to study her drawings.
- The next morning, Thimble leads Ionia and Maren to a hollow tree where the pilferers have made a nest lined with the remaining pages from her sketchbook.
- Ionia carefully recovers most of her book, though some pages are torn or stained with berry juice.
- Maren shares the story of a princess who found love with a commoner, absently touching the gold ring on her chain.
- Ionia learns the commoner sacrificed himself by entering the Eldwood to protect the princess from hunters.
- [Watcher's View] Silver light reflects off the ring as memories of centuries past drift through ancient eyes.
- On the third morning, unable to bear the thought of her father forgetting her, Ionia slips out while Maren sleeps.
- Thimble follows Ionia, chittering nervously but unwilling to let her enter the Eldwood alone.
- Crossing the boundary into the Eldwood, Ionia immediately feels a strange fog entering her mind.
- Thimble tugs at her dress, seemingly unaffected by the fog and gesturing frantically toward specific directions.
- Shadow creatures begin to move around them, herding them deeper into the Eldwood like wolves driving prey.
- Ionia encounters a deep ravine where shadow vines have destroyed the only bridge, her first major challenge.

- Thimble gets distracted by something shiny and temporarily disappears, causing Ionia momentary panic.
- That evening, Ionia and a returned Thimble encounter friendly nocturnal creatures who offer unexpected shelter.
- On the fifth day, Thimble falls into a shadow trap - gossamer black vines wrapping around the small creature.
- Ionia must choose between continuing her urgent search for Father or risking herself to save her new friend.

- [Watcher's View] Silver tears fall as unseen eyes witness the child's courage in the face of overwhelming fear.
- The unicorn appears again, its horn glowing like captured starlight, creating a protective bubble around them.
- Following the unicorn through the shifting landscape, Ionia notices her mind clears momentarily where it steps.
- Thimble stares at the unicorn with unusual reverence, his posture showing recognition without understanding why.

- Ionia finds her father standing nearby, staring at her with no recognition in his eyes.
- Wyrnox insists his law is absolute and Ionia's father must forget his human life as punishment for trespassing.
- Ionia makes desperate attempts to reach her father, showing him her drawings and singing their woodcutter's song.
- Remembering Maren's story, Ionia offers herself: "If someone must be changed by the forest, let it be me instead."
- As Wyrnox prepares to enact his judgment, the unicorn leaps between them and transforms into Maren.
- Thimble chittering stops abruptly, his eyes widening as he suddenly understands his connection to both forms.
- Maren stands beside Ionia, demonstrating how transformation born of love differs from transformation as punishment.
- Wyrnox hesitates at the sight of Maren, the only human who has lived with his magic for centuries.
- [Watcher's View] For the first time, we see through Maren's eyes directly as she stands exposed in both her forms.
- Forest creatures who witnessed Ionia's journey gather around, including nocturnal beings who sheltered her.

- Maren guides Ionia, her father, and Thimble back toward the boundary of the Eldwood.
- Father's memories continue returning through Ionia's persistent storytelling during their journey home.
- Shadow creatures watch but don't interfere, honoring Wyrnox's decision to let them leave the forest.
- As they reach the boundary, Maren explains she cannot cross into the human world except in unicorn form.
- Maren transforms into the unicorn, showing Ionia that transformation can be beautiful rather than frightening.
- Before they part, Maren gives Ionia a small seed from the heart of the Eldwood, a token of the forest's trust.
- Thimble looks back and forth between his forest home and Ionia, clearly torn about which path to choose.
- After chittering to himself and touching his nose to the unicorn's hoof, Thimble scampers to Ionia's shoulder, choosing her.
- Ionia, Father, and Thimble cross the boundary and journey toward home, surprised to see the sun hasn't moved much.
- They emerge from the forest to find Mother leading a small group of villagers searching for them.
- Mother explains that Hoofbert returned home alone yesterday with Father's axe tied to the saddle, and she knew something was wrong.
- The villagers keep their distance, noticing something different about them and pointing at Thimble with suspicion.
