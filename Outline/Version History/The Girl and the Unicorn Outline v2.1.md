**Characters:** Ionia, Father, Pilferers

At the logging camp, her father teaches Ionia about the Oldwood - an ancient sanctuary where the oldest magic still dwells, a place woodcutters dare not injure the trees. The Elder trees are sacred, and an unspoken truce exists with the woodsman that he is careful to always respect. Father leaves Ionia to sketch in her drawing book and protect their lunch as he sets off to cut the day‚Äôs load of lumber. As Ionia is sketching a forest flower, a pilferer appears, captivating her. She starts to sketch it, then notices more of the creatures. They are bright-eyed and playful, convincing Ionia that these animals are not the sneakthiefs they‚Äôve been made out to be. Of course, while she is distracted, they steal her lunch, forcing her to panic and call out for her Father‚Äôs help. His distance and loud chopping prevent him from hearing her cries, and Ionia decides to give chase to save their lunch. The pilferers lead her deep into the magical forest where she becomes disoriented and finds herself hopelessly lost.
