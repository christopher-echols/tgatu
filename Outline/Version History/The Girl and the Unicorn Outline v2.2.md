**Characters:** Ionia, Mother

Ionia wakes up hungry for bacon. She and her mother pack a lunch basket for Ionia's journey into the forest with Father. Ionia is dressed in a cotton dress with a leather belt. A small, sheathed, handmade knife is attched to the belt. She wears wool leggings and soft leather boots that come up nearly to her knees. She carries a small waxed canvas bag across her back that holds a drawing book filled with handmade paper pages, some charcoal crayons, a roll of clean cotton strips for bandages, and a small tin of beeswax for cuts and scrapes.

### 2. 
**Characters:** Ionia, Father, Hoofbert

Ionia and her father travel to his logging camp, where his careful treatment of the forest and deep knowledge of woodland signs hint at an unspoken pact with forces he never discusses.

---

### 3. 
**Characters:** Ionia, Father, Pilferers

At the logging camp, her father tells Ionia more about the Eldwood - an ancient sanctuary where the oldest magic still dwells, a place woodcutters dare not injure the trees. The Elder trees are sacred, and an unspoken truce exists with the woodsman that he is careful to always respect. Father leaves Ionia to sketch in her drawing book and protect their lunch as he sets off to cut the day‚Äôs load of lumber. As Ionia is sketching a forest flower, a pilferer appears, captivating her. She starts to sketch it, then notices more of the creatures. They are bright-eyed and playful, convincing Ionia that these animals are not the sneakthiefs they‚Äôve been made out to be. Of course, while she is distracted, they steal her lunch, forcing her to panic and call out for her Father‚Äôs help. His distance and loud chopping prevent him from hearing her cries, and Ionia decides to give chase to save their lunch. The pilferers lead her deep into the magical forest where she becomes disoriented and finds herself hopelessly lost.

### 5. 
**Characters:** Ionia, Unicorn

Following the unicorn's guidance through increasingly magical parts of the forest, Ionia begins to understand there's more to these woods than her father's stories suggest.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 6. 
**Characters:** Ionia, Unicorn, Hoofbert

The unicorn guides Ionia back to the logging camp, but her relief turns to ice in her stomach when she finds it deserted - no rhythmic sound of her father's axe, no cart loaded with fresh-cut logs. "Father?" she calls, her voice swallowed by the watchful trees. She runs to Hoofbert, still tethered where they'd left him. "Where did he go?" she asks the old mule, who only twitches his ears in response. Ionia searches the camp with growing desperation, checking behind every stump and tree, but finds only her father's abandoned axe. She knows she should wait here - that's what her father always taught her to do if she got lost. Or she could ride Hoofbert home to get help. But as she stares down the path she took chasing the pilferers, she knows with terrible certainty where her father must have gone.

### 7. 
**Characters:** Ionia, Unicorn, Mysterious Archer

Following the jumble of tracks in the soft earth - tiny pilferer prints, her own footsteps, her father's heavy boots - Ionia pushes deeper into the woods. But something strange happens to the trail; the prints begin to fade and blur, as if the forest itself is slowly erasing them. Soon she finds herself lost once again, the panic rising in her chest. Through her tears, she glimpses a familiar silvery shape - the unicorn! But as she runs toward it, a voice calls out: "Go no further." A figure drops lightly from a nearby tree, moving with impossible grace. It's a woman dressed in forest colors, with a long blonde plait and a bow across her back. Despite her woodsman's clothes, there's something etherial about her beauty, though she seems perfectly at home among the ancient trees. The archer's eyes grow dark with concern when Ionia describes being separated from her father. "He crossed into the Eldwood searching for you," she tells her. "I've seen what happens to those who enter uninvited - they forget the human world, losing their memories like leaves falling in autumn." Her fingers absently touch a simple gold ring that hangs from a chain around her neck. Though the archer's voice remains steady, her hand doesn't leave the ring at her throat. Ionia feels the weight of her own guilt crash over her - her father entered that forbidden place looking for her - but with the guilt, something stronger begins to grow: determination. She won't let her father fade away into the forest's magic like those other lost souls. As night approaches, the Archer offers Ionia shelter.
