# ACT ONE

**Morning Light**
*Ionia, Mother*
Morning dawns on the day Ionia has both dreaded and longed for - her first real journey into the deep forest with Father. While Mother packs a special lunch basket, she weaves practical warnings about woodland creatures into reassurances, knowing her daughter must learn to navigate the forest's mysteries despite her own fears for Ionia's safety.

**The Journey Begins**
*Ionia, Father, Mother, Hoofbert*
As they load Father's tools onto the cart, he's already teaching, showing Ionia how to spot a fox's trail in the dewy grass. Mother hugs Ionia tight, whispering one last warning about keeping the basket safe. Hoofbert, Ionia's old friend, seems to sense her nervous excitement, offering a gentle nuzzle as she settles the saddle blanket on his back.

**Into the Forest**
*Ionia, Father, Hoofbert*
The deeper they travel, the more alive the forest feels. Father points out deer paths and teaches her to recognize bird calls, showing her a world where every creature has its place and purpose. When they reach a fork in the path, he demonstrates how the moss on trees points their way, turning each moment into a lesson about reading the forest's signs.

**The Logging Camp**
*Ionia, Father*
They arrive at Father's workplace - a sunlit clearing dotted with fresh-cut stumps and fragrant with sawdust. He shows her the massive oak he'll fell today, explaining quickly but firmly where she can safely explore. His warning about the unmarked edge of the Eldwood nearby creates a palpable boundary, though he doesn't linger on dark tales - there will be time for deeper forest wisdom on future journeys.

**The Pilferers' Game**
*Ionia, Pilferers*
While Father works nearby, his axe rhythm steady and sure, Ionia becomes fascinated by strange creatures that emerge from the underbrush - furry things about the size of raccoons, but with clever hands and bright eyes that seem to dance as they perform an elaborate foraging display that completely distracts her from their true purpose.

**The Choice**
*Ionia, Father, Pilferers*
When Ionia realizes the pilferers have stolen her lunch basket, her calls to Father are lost in the rhythm of his axe, forcing her first real test of courage: stay safely where she was told, or follow the creatures who took not just their lunch, but her chance to prove she isn't always afraid.

**Down the Rabbit Hole**
*Ionia, Pilferers*
The pursuit leads Ionia deeper into increasingly unfamiliar woods until she slips down a muddy embankment into a stream bed, where the pilferers peer down at her with what seems like amusement before vanishing into the forest shadows.

**The Silver Light**
*Ionia, Unicorn*
Soaked and mud-covered, fighting back tears of frustration and fear, Ionia looks up to see something impossible - a creature like a horse but impossibly graceful, its spiral horn gleaming like starlight, standing in the stream before her.

**The Silent Guide**
*Ionia, Unicorn*
The unicorn leads Ionia along the stream's edge, showing her wonders of the forest she never imagined existed, until she realizes with growing amazement that they're approaching familiar territory - but when she tries to thank her magical guide, it melts away into the forest like morning mist.

**Father's Gone**
*Ionia*
Racing back to tell Father about her incredible experience, Ionia finds the camp eerily silent - no rhythmic sound of chopping, no cart loaded with fresh-cut logs, only his abandoned axe lying among the watchful trees. She's old enough now to understand exactly what this means: in searching for her, Father must have crossed the one boundary he warned her never to approach.

# ACT TWO

**A Daughter's Choice**
*Ionia, Hoofbert*
Alone at the silent camp, Ionia faces her first true test of the forest wisdom her father tried to teach her. She should wait here - that's what he always said to do if lost. Or she could ride Hoofbert home for help. But as she studies the tracks leading away from his abandoned axe, she knows he crossed into the Eldwood searching for her, and no woodsman's rule seems to matter more than that truth.

**The Hunt**
*Ionia*
Following the clear signs of her father's passage - broken branches and heavy boot prints showing his desperate search for her - Ionia pushes deeper into woods that feel increasingly ancient and watchful. Despite everything her mother's stories taught her to fear, she forces herself forward until the trail begins to fade as if the forest itself is slowly erasing it.

**Shadows Deepen**
*Ionia*
The trees grow closer together, their branches intertwining overhead until barely any sunlight reaches the forest floor. Ionia realizes she's now truly lost, in a part of the forest that feels different – older and somehow aware of her presence. Strange bird calls echo in the shadows, and unseen creatures rustle in the undergrowth.

**The Archer Appears**
*Ionia, Maren*
A woman's voice rings out clear as a bell: "Go no further." A figure drops lightly from a nearby tree - a woman dressed in forest colors, with a long blonde plait and a bow across her back. Despite her woodsman's clothes, there's something otherworldly about her beauty, though she seems perfectly at home among the ancient trees.

**Dark Tidings**
*Ionia, Maren*
The mysterious archer's eyes grow dark with concern when Ionia describes being separated from her father. "He crossed into the Eldwood searching for you," she explains, her fingers absently touching a simple gold ring that hangs from a chain around her neck. "I've seen what happens to those who enter uninvited - they forget the human world, losing their memories like leaves falling in autumn."

**Strange Lights**
*Ionia, Maren, Forest Creatures*
As darkness settles over the forest, strange lights begin to flicker between the trees. Maren explains they must find shelter before the nocturnal creatures of the boundary emerge, showing Ionia how to move with respect through their domain rather than in fear.

**Night Falls**
*Ionia, Maren*
As darkness settles, Maren leads Ionia to a cottage that seems to grow from the forest itself. Inside, while sharing a simple meal, the archer reveals hard truths about the Eldwood's transformation law and how quickly her father's memories could fade, her fingers absently touching a gold ring that hangs from a chain around her neck.

**The Princess's Choice**
*Ionia, Maren*
When Ionia asks about the ring, Maren shares a story about a princess who found love with a gentle forester, only to face the Eldwood's power when he crossed its boundary to protect her from hunters. Unable to bear the thought of her own father forgetting her as Maren's love forgot her, Ionia waits until the archer sleeps before slipping out into the darkness.

**Into Darkness**
*Ionia*
In the deep of night, tormented by visions of her father forgetting her completely, Ionia makes the conscious choice to enter the Eldwood despite Maren's warnings. This time she moves with purpose rather than fear, using what she's learned to guide her path, though each step takes her closer to the forest's transformative magic.

**The Boundary's Touch**
*Ionia*
Stepping across the invisible line into the Eldwood, Ionia immediately feels a strange fog creeping into her mind, making her question why she's out in the dark forest and what she was trying to accomplish. She clutches the memory of her father's face like a talisman, refusing to let the forest's magic wash it away.

**Shadow Dance**
*Ionia, Shadow Creatures*
As her disorientation deepens, the shadows around her begin to move with purpose, herding her deeper into the Eldwood like wolves driving prey. Each time she tries to turn back, they cut off her path, leaving only one direction - forward into the heart of the ancient forest.

**Fading Light**
*Ionia*
Driven further into the Eldwood, Ionia struggles to hold onto crucial memories – her father's lessons about reading the forest, her mother's warnings, even her own name starts to slip away as the forest's magic takes hold. The trees seem to watch her with hollow eyes as she pushes onward.

**The Silver Horn**
*Ionia, Unicorn*
At her moment of greatest crisis, when the shadows press in closest and her memories feel most distant, a brilliant light cuts through the darkness. The unicorn appears again, its horn glowing like captured starlight, creating a protective bubble that temporarily holds back the forest's transformation magic.

**Path of Starlight**
*Ionia, Unicorn*
Following the unicorn through the ever-shifting landscape of the deep Eldwood, Ionia notices that where the creature steps, her mind clears momentarily. Though it never speaks, its presence seems to ask if she's willing to trust in magic she doesn't understand to save someone she loves.

**The Elder's Grove**
*Ionia, Unicorn, Woodland Elder*
The unicorn leads her into a grove of impossibly ancient trees where the very air changes. A presence makes itself known through every leaf, branch, and breath of wind – the consciousness of the Woodland Elder speaking through the voice of the forest itself.

**Many Voices**
*Ionia, Woodland Elder*
Through every tree in the grove, the Elder's consciousness emerges as many harmonizing voices that examine Ionia's heart. They see her fear, but also her determination to save her father, reminding her that she's not the first to enter these woods driven by love rather than greed.

**Ancient Laws**
*Ionia, Woodland Elder, Unicorn*
The Elder reveals the price of entering uninvited – Ionia's father's memories are already beginning to fade. But there was another who once entered these woods seeking someone lost to the forest's magic, one whose love moved the Elder to offer a different kind of transformation.

**The Truth Revealed**
*Ionia, Woodland Elder, Unicorn*
As the Elder speaks of the princess, the unicorn's eyes meet Ionia's with profound understanding. In that silent exchange, Ionia realizes she stands before Maren in her true form – the bridge between human and forest worlds, forever changed by the depth of her love.

**The Deep Wood Beckons**
*Ionia, Unicorn, Woodland Elder*
The Elder explains that Ionia must continue alone into Wyrnox's domain. The ancient spirit who rules the deep woods cannot be reasoned with or avoided – only faced with truth and love. Though they can protect her no further, the unicorn's gentle nod reminds her of something vital: transformation doesn't always mean loss.
