# The Girl and the Unicorn

## [[01. Breakfast]]

Ionia opened her eyes.

The first rays of morning light filtered through her window, warming her face. Under the heavy quilt, nestled in that place between dreaming and waking, Ionia felt so comfortable, so safe.  Just a few more minutes.

She closed her eyes again and snuggled deeper into the blankets, wanting nothing more than to stay in this cozy cocoon forever.

“Ionia!”

She opened her eyes again.

“Your father is packing the cart,” her mother called from the kitchen. “Time to be up and off.”

Ionia’s father was a woodcutter. He ventured into the forest day after day to chop trees. He was a strong, gentle man; a man who lived simply and purposefully and respected the land.

Her mother was a craftswoman who made fine furniture from the wood Ionia's father brought from the forest. In a simple workshop behind their cottage, she built sturdy tables and chairs, turned wooden bowls, and even carved intricate figurines to sell in the village.

They lived together in a cottage on the outskirts of The Great Northwood Forest. It was a small house with three rooms, two small beds, and a nice big fireplace that kept the family warm during the cold winter months. Her parents had built the cottage, with skill and love, before Ionia was born. It was her favorite place in the whole world.

Ionia pulled back the covers and climbed out of bed. Sleep evaporated from her like mist rising from a pond. She dressed, scrubbed her teeth with a bristle brush, and quickly braided her  messy hair into a manageable plait.

“I’m ready,” she said as she joined her mother by the kitchen stove. “For breakfast, that is.”

Her mother chuckled and handed Ionia a shiny apple.

“Breakfast,” her mother said.

Ionia scrunched her nose at the apple and stuffed it into her pocket. That wasn’t the breakfast she’d imagined. The cottage was awash with the smell of fresh smoked bacon, and Ionia’s stomach would settle for nothing less than two crispy slices with jam on bread.

“Bacon’s going in ‘ee lunch basket,” her mother said, wrapping a slab of sliced pork in cheesecloth and tying the bundle with twine. “Except that there,” she said with a smile, nodding her head toward a plate on the stove. Two perfectly fried strips of bacon lay atop a thick slice of her mother’s fresh baked bread, slathered with blackberry jam.

“A proper breakfast!” Ionia squealed, lifting the plate over her head and turning in a little circle. “I won’t starve to death after all.” Her mother gave her a look of mocking reproach as she continued packing the handmade wicker basket. In went a loaf of bread, some cheese, two apples, a raw honeycomb, and, of course, the bacon. She filled a leather waterskin with cool spring water sweetened with honey and fresh mint from their garden, and tucked it in.

“Keep the lid shut tight, Ionia,” her mother said with note of caution in her voice. “Ratty pilferers’ll sneak off with your lunch, and that’s all the good bacon we’ve left until summer.”

Her mother, like many villagers, was wary of the deep forest and often warned Ionia about its dangers. Pilferers and muck-mucks seemed harmless enough to Ionia, but the creatures of the Eldwood were different. They were ... unnatural ... made by ancient magic. They were what kept all but men like her father from venturing into the woods.

The village children sometimes played games at dusk where one would pretend to be lost in the Eldwood, the others prowling, howling, and screeching like Shadowseekers in the growing darkness. They frightened her, even though she pretended they didn’t. Most of all, she feared the Woodland Elder, an ancient tree that was said to guard the forest from humans. The Elder knew your thoughts and used magic to curse those who ventured too far into the Eldwood.

But despite all her mother’s warnings, or maybe because of them, Ionia had never seen any of those creatures.

For the most part, Ionia stayed close to her little home, uneasy about venturing too far into the woods when she played. Her father, who knew the forest, tried to teach her not to fear the unknown.

“Every creature ‘as its place, girl,” he would say. “An’ a part to play.”

He would show her how to spot the tracks that deer left in the soft earth near their cottage, and taught her to recognize birds by their songs.

"See how the moss grows thicker on the north side of the trees?" he would say, guiding her hand to feel the fuzzy green growth. "The forest gives us signs, if we know how to read them."

There were other stories too, whispered amongst the village children for as long as anyone could remember. The most magical of all were the tales of a unicorn, a horse with a long spiral horn that glowed like starlight. Some of the children claimed they had glanced it running through a dell or found strands of silvery hair floating down the woodland stream. Really! They swore it was true. But children had such vivid imaginations. No one, certainly not the grown-ups anyway, actually believed them.

Still, on some nights, when Ionia would fall asleep to the sound of wind whispering in the trees, she would dream about the unicorn. In her dreams, it would bow its beautiful head and let her touch its silver mane. In the morning, she would wake, sure she had met the unicorn for real. But those were just dreams.

Ionia's father loaded a long toothy saw, his heavy axe, and the wicker lunch basket onto his wooden log cart. Harnessed to the cart was the family's old gray mule, Hoofbert.

Hoofbert and Ionia were friends. Although the mule never wanted to play, she did love being fed apples and carrots and being stroked behind the ears, which Ionia happily did for her almost every day. This morning, Ionia had even given Hoofbert half her own breakfast apple, earning a gentle nuzzle that made her giggle.

"You're a good friend, Hoofbert," she whispered, stroking the mule's soft nose. "You'll help keep us safe in the forest today, won't you?"

Hoofbert's ears twitched at the sound of her voice, and Ionia took that as a yes. When Ionia threw a threadbare saddle blanket onto her back, Hoofbert's ears perked up. The old mule knew there would be extra ear scratches today. Ionia, her father, and the mule set off down the forest track just as the sun was coming up. They waved goodbye to her mother, who was headed into her workshop before they were even out of sight.

A stream ran down from the forest and meandered south, alongside the rutted road, to the village a few miles away.

As the cart rolled along the long, muddy tracks and into the woods, Ionia saw a wrangle of deer nibbling on slender stalks of grass. The clanking and bumping of the cart's wooden wheels made the animals stop their grazing and turn their heads, eyes and ears alert to the travelers. A rabbit darted across the path in front of Hoofbert and hid in a mass of dew-flecked purple flowers beside the road.

"Look how they move," her father said quietly, nodding toward the deer. "Always watching, always listening. They know how to read the forest too."

Their journey had only just begun, but Ionia was already hungry, having shared her breakfast with Hoofbert. To distract herself from thinking about the delicious, smoky bacon packed away in the wicker basket, she started to sing. The song was one her father had made up when she was very young. It went like this:

*The woodsman treks into the grove,*
*With axe and cart, to work he goes,*
*Mule and meal and lamp for light,*
*He chops the logs with all his might.*

As if on cue, her father joined in with his deep, boomy voice:

*The woodsman knows each tree by heart,*
*When grown up tall he plays his part,*
*Noble wood for house and hearth,*
*He loves the trees but knows their worth.*

The two of them sang their little song as loudly and happily as they liked, sometimes making up new verses or changing the words to silly rhymes. Ionia noticed how the forest seemed to listen to their singing - how the leaves would sometimes shake without any wind, as if the trees were laughing at their made-up verses. But that was silly, of course. Trees didn't really laugh or listen.

They continued on and on until they finally reached the logging camp deep in the forest. By the time they arrived and her father unloaded the cart, Ionia was starving. She couldn't know then that this ordinary morning was about to become the most extraordinary day of her life.

## [[04. The Logging Camp]]

The logging camp was little more than a clearing where several large trees had been felled. Thick stumps dotted the ground like giant's teeth, and sawdust carpeted the forest floor in a golden blanket. Ionia's father had already begun setting up his work area, laying out his tools and checking the edge of his axe blade one final time.

"Stay where I can see you," he called over his shoulder as Ionia slid down from Hoofbert's back. "And remember what yer mother said about the basket!"

Ionia nodded, though her stomach growled so loudly she was sure even the birds could hear it. She found a comfortable spot on one of the stumps, setting the wicker basket beside her. The morning sun filtered through the canopy above, creating shifting patterns on the ground that reminded her of the lace on her mother's best tablecloth.

She watched as her father began work on a tall oak tree, his axe swinging in a steady rhythm that echoed through the woods. Each stroke was careful, purposeful – he never took more than the forest could spare, and always planted new seedlings in spring.

A flash of movement caught her eye – something small and quick darting between the stumps. Probably just another rabbit, she thought. But then she saw it again, closer this time. It wasn't a rabbit at all, but a creature about the size of a large rat, with bright eyes and a twitching nose. A pilferer! Just like in her mother's warnings!

Before Ionia could grab the basket, three more pilferers emerged from behind nearby stumps. They moved with astonishing speed, working together like a well-practiced pack. One scampered in circles, drawing her attention, while the others crept up behind her. By the time she realized what was happening, they had already snatched the basket and were darting away into the underbrush.

"Hey! Come back!" Ionia jumped up from her stump, her hunger forgotten in the excitement of the chase. "Father, the pilferers have our lunch!"

But the steady rhythm of his axe continued – the sound probably masked her voice. The pilferers were quick, but their short legs meant they had to work harder to navigate through the forest debris. She could just make out the wicker basket bobbing between them as they passed it back and forth like a game.

"Please stop!" she called after them, though this only seemed to encourage their game. They were taking turns carrying the basket now, their tails held high as they ran. Despite her frustration, Ionia couldn't help but admire their cleverness.

She was so focused on following the pilferers that she didn't notice how the forest was changing around her. The trees were growing closer together, their branches intertwining overhead until barely any sunlight reached the forest floor. The familiar sounds of her father's axe had faded away entirely, replaced by strange bird calls and the rustling of unseen creatures in the undergrowth.

Finally, the pilferers disappeared into a hollow log, taking her basket with them. Ionia dropped to her knees and peered into the dark opening, but she could see nothing inside. As she sat back on her heels, catching her breath, the reality of her situation slowly dawned on her.

The forest looked different here. The trees were older, their trunks twisted into strange shapes she'd never seen before. Thick vines hung from their branches like rope, and the air felt heavier, filled with unfamiliar scents of earth and decay and something else – something older and stranger than anything she'd known.

She turned in a circle, trying to spot something – anything – that might help her find her way back to the logging camp. But every direction looked the same. The trees seemed to watch her with hollow knots like eyes, and the branches creaked overhead though there was no wind.

For the first time since the chase began, Ionia felt a flutter of fear in her chest. She was lost in the deep woods, exactly where her mother had always warned her not to go. Worse still, she had no idea which way would lead her back to her father.

"Stay calm," she whispered to herself, remembering her father's teachings. "Look for signs you recognize."

But nothing here looked familiar. A twig snapped somewhere in the darkness beyond the trees, and Ionia froze. Something was moving out there, something much bigger than a pilferer. And as the shadows deepened around her, she realized that her mother's warnings about the forest's creatures hadn't been just stories after all.
