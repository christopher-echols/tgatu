The unicorn had been watching the girl for seven seasons, though the girl had no way of knowing unicorns could count.

From the shadow of ancient oaks, Stellara observed the small human with her careful movements, her gentle hands gathering eggs from beneath sleepy hens. How peculiar these morning rituals—so different from the forest's eternal rhythms, yet comforting in their quiet certainty. Something about this particular child had drawn Stellara to this cottage at the forest's edge, season after season, watching the girl grow taller, her movements more assured, though still touched with that endearing caution.

There was something about her—something that called across the boundary between worlds. Something familiar that shimmered like a memory from centuries past.

...

Ionia froze, egg warm in her palm, suddenly certain she wasn't alone. The back of her neck prickled, and she turned slowly toward the tree line. Morning mist still clung to the forest edge, but for an instant, she thought she glimpsed something silver—like moonlight that had forgotten to fade with the dawn.

"Ionia!" Her mother's voice broke the moment. "Don't dawdle with those eggs. Your father is packing the cart."

The feeling of being watched faded as Ionia carefully placed the last egg in her basket. Still, she cast one more glance toward the forest before hurrying inside, whispering to herself, "I know you're there," though she couldn't have explained who—or what—she was speaking to.

In the space between heartbeats, the unicorn remembered being human.

Stellara stood at the edge of the ancient forest, her silver coat dappled by the morning sun as it filtered through the leaves. Her dark eyes, fathomless and wise, watched the cottage nestled at the woodland's boundary. How many seasons had she observed the girl who lived there, the child with the cautious hands and the curious heart?

Time flowed differently for Stellara, marked not by the rise and fall of the sun but by the whispered secrets of the trees. Yet something about this girl drew her back, season after season, to witness the small rituals of a life both strange and achingly familiar.

As the girl emerged from the cottage, a basket balanced on her hip, Stellara felt an ancient stirring—a memory of a time when she, too, had walked on two legs and felt the warm weight of a newly laid egg in her palm.

The girl moved through her morning chores with a gentle purposefulness, her dark hair catching the sun as she collected eggs and tended to the sleepy hens. Stellara watched, hardly daring to breathe, as the girl paused, her hand frozen above the last egg.

Slowly, the child turned toward the forest, her eyes searching the dappled shadows. For a heartbeat, their gazes met—the ancient being and the young girl, separated by centuries and species yet connected by a thread as old as time itself.

"Ionia!" A woman's voice shattered the moment, and the girl blinked, the spell broken. "Don't dawdle with those eggs. Your father is packing the cart."

The girl cast one last glance toward the forest before hurrying inside, the basket clutched tight to her chest. But Stellara heard the whispered words carried on the breeze: "I know you're there."

And she was. She always would be, waiting in the space between the girl's world and her own, guarding the secrets that bound them across the ages.

As the cottage door closed, Stellara turned back to the forest, her hooves leaving no mark on the dew-kissed grass. The ancient oaks welcomed her, their leaves whispering stories older than human memory.

For now, she would watch. But the time was coming when the girl would step across the boundary and into the realm of magic and memory. When she would need a guide to light her way through the shadows.

And on that day, Stellara would be waiting, ready to lead her into the heart of the forest and the depths of her own untapped courage.
