# Chapter Six: Reading the Forest's Signs

The afternoon light slanted golden through the trees as Ionia pressed onward. Her father's trail was growing fresher – here a recently snapped twig, there the clear impression of his boot in a patch of mud. But the forest itself was growing stranger. The trees seemed to lean inward as she passed, their ancient branches creaking softly overhead like whispered conversations.

She paused to catch her breath beside a fallen log covered in shelf mushrooms that glowed with a faint, greenish light. The forest was different here than anywhere she had been before. The air felt thick with age and secrets, and even the shadows seemed deeper, as if they held memories of their own.

A patch of whisperweed grew beside the log, its silvery stalks swaying though there was no wind. As Ionia watched, the plants bent toward a narrow gap between two massive oaks, their movement so deliberate it couldn't be natural. When she spoke aloud, wondering which way to go, the whisperweed quivered as if responding to her voice.

"You're trying to help me too, aren't you?" she asked softly. The grass stalks rippled in response, and she felt a smile touch her lips despite her worry. It seemed her mother's warnings about the forest's creatures had left out quite a lot about the forest itself.

As if in answer to this thought, she spotted more of the mysterious hoofprints, their silvery gleam barely visible in the deepening shadows. They wove between her father's tracks now, as if the unicorn was following him too. Or perhaps it was marking the safest path for Ionia to follow.

She had just started forward again when a sound froze her in place – the snap of a branch, followed by heavy breathing. Something large was moving in the undergrowth ahead. Through the trees, she caught glimpses of dark shapes – not one muck-muck this time, but several, moving together through the forest.

Ionia's heart jumped into her throat. One muck-muck was dangerous enough, but a whole group? She looked frantically for somewhere to hide, but the nearby trees were too big to climb quickly, and there were no convenient root hollows this time.

Just then, she noticed white flowers blooming rapidly in a line to her left, leading toward a thick stand of ferns. Without hesitation, she followed them, crouching low among the feathery fronds. The flowers continued to appear, showing her how to crawl deeper into the fern patch until she found herself in a small hollow screened by the plants.

The muck-mucks crashed through the area where she had been standing moments before. Through gaps in the ferns, she could see their massive bodies, their curved tusks, their small eyes scanning the forest floor. One of them stopped barely an arm's length from her hiding place, its broad nose twitching as it sniffed the air.

Ionia held her breath, remembering how her father had once told her that staying still was often better than running. The massive creature's breath stirred the ferns near her face. She could smell its musty fur and see the coarse bristles along its side. One step closer and it would surely find her.

Suddenly, there was a flash of silver-white deeper in the forest – just the briefest glimpse, but the muck-mucks all turned toward it, their ears pricked forward. Another flash, further away, and the creatures moved off in that direction, their heavy bodies pushing through the undergrowth with surprising speed.

Only when the sound of their passage had faded completely did Ionia dare to move. As she crawled out from the ferns, she noticed something odd about where the muck-mucks had gone – there were no white flowers blooming in that direction, no silvery hoofprints marking the path. The unicorn, it seemed, had purposely led the creatures away from her.

"Thank you," she whispered, though she wasn't sure if the unicorn could hear. But new flowers were already blooming along her father's trail, and she felt certain that somewhere, hidden in the deepening shadows of the forest, something was watching over her still.

With renewed determination, Ionia continued following the signs – both her father's familiar tracks and the forest's magical markers. The sun was sinking lower, and she knew she needed to find him before dark. But somehow, she felt less afraid than she had before. She was learning to read the forest's language, to understand its warnings and accept its help.

What she didn't know was that she was walking deeper into the heart of the forest's magic, toward something ancient and wonderful that had been waiting for someone just like her – someone who could see and understand and believe.
