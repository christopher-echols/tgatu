# Chapter Ten: Walking Between Worlds

The ember moths stayed with them as they left the wedding clearing, their warm light guiding the way through the nighttime forest. Ionia walked beside the unicorn now, no longer following behind. She felt different somehow – as if the wedding feast had awakened something in her, some deeper understanding of both magic and herself.

The forest at night was full of wonders she had never seen before. Mushrooms glowed with a pale blue light along fallen logs. Night-blooming flowers opened their petals, releasing sweet scents into the cool air. Moonlight filtered through the canopy above, creating patches of silver on the forest floor that seemed to move and shift like water.

She still looked for signs of her father's passage, but now she noticed other things too – the way certain branches bent to mark safe paths, how moss grew thicker where the ground was sturdy, the subtle patterns in bark that told stories about the trees' long lives. The forest was speaking its own language, and she was beginning to understand it.

The unicorn moved differently now as well. Instead of appearing and disappearing, it stayed close beside her, its presence steady and reassuring. When they reached difficult passages, it would pause, waiting patiently while Ionia found her way. Sometimes it would indicate a better path with a slight turn of its head or a subtle shift of its body, but it no longer needed to lead her directly.

They crossed a small stream where the water sang quiet songs over smooth stones. As Ionia carefully picked her way across, she noticed how the unicorn's hooves barely seemed to touch the water's surface. Light rippled out from each step, as if the creature walked on starlight rather than water.

On the other bank, they found fresh signs of her father's passage – a recently broken branch, a clear bootprint in soft earth. The trail was getting warmer. But something was changing in the forest around them. The ancient trees were beginning to thin, giving way to younger growth. The air felt different too, more like the woods near home.

The unicorn's steps grew hesitant. Several times it stopped completely, looking back the way they had come. Ionia noticed how its coat seemed to shine less brightly here, as if something about this part of the forest dimmed its magic.

She thought about the princess and her love, about choices and courage and following one's heart. The unicorn had led her through the deepest parts of the forest, shown her wonders she would never forget. But now she could sense that their journey together was coming to an end.

The ember moths seemed to understand this too. One by one, they began to drift away, returning to the deeper, more magical parts of the forest. Their light faded gradually, like sunset giving way to dusk, until only a few remained to light the path ahead.

Ionia could see another stream in the distance, this one wider than the first. Even in the fading light of the remaining ember moths, she could make out stepping stones making a natural bridge across the water. And there, clear as could be in the mud of the far bank, was a fresh print from her father's boot.

She knew, somehow, that this stream marked a boundary – not just between different parts of the forest, but between the magical realm she had walked through and the more ordinary world beyond. The unicorn's gift had been showing her that both worlds were real, both valuable, both part of the forest's true nature.

As the last ember moths drifted away into the darkness, Ionia felt her heart grow heavy with understanding. The next part of her journey would be different. But perhaps that was as it should be.
