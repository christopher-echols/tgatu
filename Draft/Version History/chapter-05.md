# Chapter Five: The Deepening Wood

As the afternoon shadows lengthened across the empty logging camp, Ionia tried to think like her father. He wouldn't have given up searching for her. But he also wouldn't have stayed in one place – he would have gone looking, just as she had done when chasing the pilferers.

She studied the disturbed sawdust around her father's work area, remembering how he had taught her to look for signs of deer and rabbits in the soft earth near their cottage. There were marks from his heavy boots, crossing and recrossing the clearing. Hoofbert's prints were there too, but they led in several different directions, as if they had circled the camp many times.

"Which way did you go?" she whispered, more to herself than to anyone else. A cool breeze stirred the leaves overhead, carrying with it the sweet, musty scent of mushrooms and damp earth. And there – just at the edge of the clearing, she spotted something promising: a broken twig at just the height her father's shoulder would brush past.

Following this first sign, she found others: a scraped patch of bark where he might have steadied himself, some scattered leaves where heavy boots had passed. Her father had taught her well, even if she hadn't known she was learning at the time.

As she followed these signs, Ionia began to notice other things too. Delicate white flowers would sometimes spring up beside her father's tracks, as if marking the path. Once, when she wasn't sure which way to go, a strange breeze rustled through a patch of tall grass that her father called whisperweed. The stalks all bent in the same direction, though the air was still everywhere else.

"Did he go that way?" she asked aloud, and the whisperweed trembled again, as if nodding.

She pressed deeper into the forest, which grew older and stranger with each step. The trees here were massive, their trunks wider than her family's cottage. Their branches reached so high she could barely see where they ended, and their roots created great archways above the ground, like doorways to hidden places.

Her father's boot prints had become harder to follow. The ground here was carpeted with thick moss and fallen leaves that held no tracks. But every so often, she would catch a glimpse of silvery hoofprints, glowing faintly in the dimness. They always seemed to appear just when she was most uncertain which way to turn.

The forest felt different here – more alive, more aware. Sometimes she thought she saw movement in the corner of her eye, but when she turned to look, there was only the slow dance of shadows and light. The very air seemed to whisper with ancient secrets.

A strange sound stopped her in her tracks – a deep, rumbling snuffle that seemed to come from just ahead. Ionia froze, remembering her mother's warnings about muck-mucks. The sound came again, closer this time, followed by the crack of breaking branches.

Through a gap in the vegetation, she caught a glimpse of something large moving through the undergrowth. It had bristly brown fur and curved tusks that gleamed dully in the filtered sunlight. A real muck-muck! The creature was even bigger than she had imagined, with a broad, flat nose that moved constantly as it sniffed the ground.

Ionia's heart pounded. The muck-muck was between her and where she thought her father's trail led. She looked around frantically for somewhere to hide, when suddenly she noticed more of the white flowers blooming rapidly to her right, creating a curved path away from the creature.

As quietly as she could, she followed the flower trail. It led her to a hollow space beneath the roots of a nearby tree. She had barely concealed herself when the muck-muck crashed past her hiding place, close enough that she could smell its musty fur and hear its heavy breathing.

For a long moment, nothing moved. Then, with a dismissive snort, the muck-muck turned and crashed away through the undergrowth, heading deeper into the forest.

Ionia let out her breath slowly. Her legs were shaking, but she felt oddly proud of herself. She had seen a real muck-muck – something even most grown-ups never managed – and she had kept her head just as her father would have done. The flowers that had shown her where to hide were already starting to fade, but new ones were blooming ahead, showing her the way forward.

She thought of the unicorn, remembering how it had led her back to the logging camp. Perhaps it was still watching over her, hidden among the trees. The thought gave her courage as she continued on, following both her father's signs and the subtle magic that seemed to be guiding her deeper into the ancient forest.
