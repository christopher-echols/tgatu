# The Girl and the Unicorn

## Chapter Seven: Ember Moths' Light

The sun was setting, turning the forest into a maze of deepening shadows. Ionia knew she should be frightened – her mother had always warned her never to be in the deep woods after dark. But something had changed since her meeting with the Woodland Elder. The darkness felt different here, more like a soft blanket settling over the forest than something to fear.

Still, it was getting harder to see the signs she had been following. Her father's trail was barely visible in the fading light, and even the unicorn's silvery hoof-prints seemed dimmer. The white flowers that had helped guide her way were closing their petals for the night.

Just as Ionia was wondering if she should try to find a safe place to wait until morning, she noticed something unusual. At first, she thought she was seeing the last gleams of sunlight caught in spider webs. But these lights were moving, drifting through the air like tiny, glowing embers.

One floated closer, and she saw it wasn't a spark at all, but a moth. Its wings shimmered with a warm, copper light, as if it had captured sunset in its delicate patterns. Another appeared, then another, until the darkening forest was filled with their gentle radiance.

The ember moths seemed to be gathering around her, their light casting a warm glow that made it easier to see the path ahead. As they danced through the air, Ionia noticed how their wings pulsed with light – brightening and dimming like slow heartbeats. The effect was mesmerizing, almost like music made visible.

From somewhere deeper in the forest came a sound – not the ice-chimes she had heard before, but something softer, sweeter. It reminded her of the songs her mother hummed while working in her workshop, but mixed with the whisper of wind through leaves and the gentle patter of rain on flower petals.

The ember moths' wing-beats seemed to pulse in time with this distant music. They swirled through the air more purposefully now, as if they were being drawn toward something. A few drifted ahead along the path, their light creating golden pools in the darkness.

"Are you trying to show me something?" Ionia whispered to them.

The moths danced higher, their light growing brighter for just a moment, and Ionia felt sure they were answering her. The distant music swelled slightly, carried on a warm breeze that held the scent of night-blooming flowers.

She followed the ember moths deeper into the forest, which was transforming in the darkness. Mushrooms glowed with a pale blue light along fallen logs. Luminous vines wrapped ancient tree trunks, creating spirals of gentle radiance. Night-blooming flowers opened their petals, releasing sweet perfumes into the cool air.

The path led upward, winding between massive trees whose branches wove together far overhead. The higher they climbed, the more ember moths appeared, until the air was filled with their gentle light. Their wings created patterns of shadow and radiance that seemed to tell stories Ionia could almost understand.

At the top of the rise, something made her pause. The music was clearer now, and she could hear voices mixed with it – soft laughter, gentle murmurs, and what might have been singing, though in no language she knew. The ember moths swirled excitedly around her, their light growing brighter, pulling her forward toward whatever celebration lay ahead.

## Chapter Eight: The Secret Wedding

The natural amphitheater was formed by massive trees growing in a perfect circle, their branches weaving together far overhead to create a living dome. Ember moths swirled through the air in graceful spirals, their glowing wings casting warm light over a scene that seemed to come straight from Ionia's dreams.

Garlands of white and purple flowers hung between the trees, swaying gently though there was no wind. The ground was carpeted with soft ferns that seemed to shimmer with their own inner light. Woodland creatures gathered in respectful silence – deer with wise eyes, foxes with gleaming coats, rabbits sitting very still and proper, even a pair of muck-mucks who looked much less frightening now, like gentle giants watching over the smaller creatures.

And there, in the center of this magical space, stood two figures. One wore a crown of golden leaves and a dress that seemed woven from moonlight itself. The other was dressed simply in brown and green, like a forest worker, but stood just as tall and proud as their companion. They held hands, speaking softly to each other while the forest held its breath.

Ionia hardly dared to breathe herself. She stood at the edge of the clearing, partially hidden behind a curtain of hanging moss. The moths around her had stilled their dancing, their light soft and steady now, as if they too were waiting for something wonderful to begin.

A familiar flash of silver-white caught her eye. The unicorn stepped into the clearing, its horn gathering all the scattered lights until it glowed like a star. It moved to stand behind the couple, and Ionia understood – this place, this moment, was why the unicorn had led her here.

The princess reached up to touch her love's face with such tenderness that it made Ionia's heart ache. Though she couldn't hear their words, she could see it in their eyes – the same kind of certainty she had felt when following the unicorn's path, when trusting in the forest's guidance.

The ember moths began to spiral more quickly, their light intensifying as the music swelled. The couple kissed, and in that moment, every creature in the clearing seemed to join in celebration. Deer stamped their hooves softly against the earth. Foxes brushed their tails against the ground in flowing patterns. Birds trilled quiet songs from the branches above. Even the ancient trees seemed to sway with joy.

Ionia felt tears in her eyes, though she couldn't have said why. The princess turned then, as if sensing her presence. Their eyes met across the clearing, and the woman smiled – a warm, radiant smile that made Ionia feel like she was exactly where she was meant to be. The princess beckoned with her free hand.

"Welcome, forest friend," she said, her voice musical and kind. "Will you join our feast?"

Before Ionia could answer, the woodland creatures began bringing forward gifts. Squirrels offered nuts and berries, bees brought honeycomb dripping with golden sweetness, and birds presented perfect, ripe fruits. The couple shared everything with Ionia, and though she had eaten nothing since breakfast, she found that just a few bites filled her with warmth and renewed energy.

As they ate, the princess and her love told their story in quiet voices – of meetings in the village market, of walks that grew longer and longer, of finding in each other something that mattered more than the rules about who should marry whom. They spoke of the forest welcoming them when the village would not, of the peace they had found here among the ancient trees and magical creatures.

Ionia listened, watching how the ember moths danced around them, how the unicorn stood guard nearby, how even the fearsome muck-mucks had come to witness their joy. The forest that had seemed so frightening that morning now felt like the most natural place in the world for a princess to find her happiness.

## Chapter Nine: The Heart's Choice

As the wedding celebration continued around her, Ionia noticed the first pale light of dawn creeping through the branches far overhead. With it came two paths leading away from the amphitheater.

One was broad and clear, marked by her father's familiar boot prints – she could tell he had passed this way not long ago. That path led back to the logging camp, to the safe and familiar forest she had always known.

The other path was narrower, marked by the unicorn's silvery hoof-prints and lined with the white flowers that had guided her here. It led deeper into the magical forest, promising more wonders, more mysteries.

The unicorn appeared beside her, as silent as starlight. It looked first toward one path, then the other. Its eyes held the same gentle wisdom Ionia had seen in the princess's smile, in the Elder's ancient face, in the forest itself.

She thought about everything she had seen – the pilferers who had led her into adventure, the whisperweed that had helped guide her way, the muck-mucks who now seemed more like guardians than monsters. She remembered how the forest had changed from something frightening to something wonderful, not because the forest itself was different, but because she had learned to see it differently.

The ember moths still danced around her, their light growing softer as dawn approached. One landed briefly on her hand, its wings glowing with the last warmth of night.

"I know which way to go," she said softly.

The unicorn dipped its head, its horn catching the first rays of morning sun. Taking a deep breath, Ionia stepped forward onto her chosen path, ready to discover what lay ahead. The white flowers bloomed beneath her feet, a reminder of all the magic she had witnessed, all the wonders still waiting to be found.
