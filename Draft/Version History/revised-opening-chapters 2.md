# Chapter One: The Woodcutter's Song

Ionia lived in a small cottage near the forest. The house had only three rooms and two small beds, but a nice big fireplace kept her family warm and cozy during the cold winter months. Her father was a woodcutter who ventured into the forest day after day to chop trees. He was a strong, gentle man; a man who lived simply and purposefully and respected the land. Her mother, a craftswoman, made fine furniture from the wood Ionia's father brought from the forest. In a simple workshop behind their cottage, she built sturdy tables and chairs, turned wooden bowls, and even carved intricate figurines to sell in the village.

For the most part, Ionia stayed close to her little home, uneasy about venturing too far into the woods when she played. But once in a while, she went with her father into the deep forest to keep him company while he worked. He would show her how to spot the tracks that deer left in the soft earth near their cottage, and taught her to recognize birds by their songs.

"See how the moss grows thicker on the north side of the trees?" he would say, guiding her hand to feel the fuzzy green growth. "The forest gives us signs, if we know how to read them."

Our story begins on one of those days. Ionia and her mother packed a lunch of sandwiches, apples, bacon, and fresh honeycomb into a handmade wicker basket. The food in that basket was like a precious treasure – father would need his strength for a long day's work.

"Keep the lid shut tight, Ionia," her mother said, wrapping a slab of smoked bacon in a cloth. Her voice held the same mix of love and worry it always did when Ionia ventured into the deep woods. "So pilferers don't sneak off with your lunch."

Her mother, like many villagers, was wary of the forest and warned her often about the dangers it held. Pilferers were clever rodents who stole food and trinkets from travelers. Muck-mucks were huge, smelly creatures with tusks that could knock down small trees. And there was the Woodland Elder, an ancient tree that was said to guard the creatures of the forest from humans. But Ionia had never seen any of those creatures.

There were other stories too, whispered amongst the village children for as long as anyone could remember. The most magical of all were the tales of a unicorn, a horse with a long spiral horn that glowed like starlight. Some of the children claimed they had glanced it running through a dell or found strands of silvery hair floating down the woodland stream. Really! They swore it was true. But children had such vivid imaginations. No one, certainly not the grown-ups anyway, actually believed them.

Still, on some nights, when Ionia would fall asleep to the sound of wind whispering in the trees, she would dream about the unicorn. In her dreams, it would bow its beautiful head and let her touch its silver mane. In the morning, she would wake, sure she had met the unicorn for real. But those were just dreams.

Ionia's father loaded a long toothy saw, his heavy axe, and the wicker lunch basket onto his wooden log cart. Harnessed to the cart was the family's old gray mule, Hoofbert.

Hoofbert and Ionia were friends. Although the mule never wanted to play, she did love being fed apples and carrots and being stroked behind the ears, which Ionia happily did for her almost every day. This morning, Ionia had even given Hoofbert half her own breakfast apple, earning a gentle nuzzle that made her giggle.

"You're a good friend, Hoofbert," she whispered, stroking the mule's soft nose. "You'll help keep us safe in the forest today, won't you?"

Hoofbert's ears twitched at the sound of her voice, and Ionia took that as a yes. When Ionia threw a threadbare saddle blanket onto her back, Hoofbert's ears perked up. The old mule knew there would be extra ear scratches today. Ionia, her father, and the mule set off down the forest track just as the sun was coming up. They waved goodbye to her mother, who was headed into her workshop before they were even out of sight.

As the cart rolled along the long, muddy tracks and into the woods, Ionia saw a wrangle of deer nibbling on slender stalks of grass. The clanking and bumping of the cart's wooden wheels made the animals stop their grazing and turn their heads, eyes and ears alert to the travelers. A rabbit darted across the path in front of Hoofbert and hid in a mass of dew-flecked purple flowers beside the road.

"Look how they move," her father said quietly, nodding toward the deer. "Always watching, always listening. They know how to read the forest too."

Their journey had only just begun, but Ionia was already hungry, having shared her breakfast with Hoofbert. To distract herself from thinking about the delicious, smoky bacon packed away in the wicker basket, she started to sing. The song was one her father had made up when she was very young. It went like this:

The woodsman treks into the grove,
With axe and cart, to work he goes,
Mule and meal and lamp for light,
He chops the logs with all his might.

As if on cue, her father joined in with his deep, boomy voice:

The woodsman knows each tree by heart,
When grown up tall he plays his part,
Noble wood for house and hearth,
He loves the trees but knows their worth.

The two of them sang their little song as loudly and happily as they liked, sometimes making up new verses or changing the words to silly rhymes. Ionia noticed how the forest seemed to listen to their singing - how the leaves would sometimes shake without any wind, as if the trees were laughing at their made-up verses. But that was silly, of course. Trees didn't really laugh or listen.

They continued on and on until they finally reached the logging camp deep in the forest. By the time they arrived and her father unloaded the cart, Ionia was starving. She couldn't know then that this ordinary morning was about to become the most extraordinary day of her life.

# Chapter Two: The Chase Begins

The logging camp was little more than a clearing where several large trees had been felled. Thick stumps dotted the ground like giant's teeth, and sawdust carpeted the forest floor in a golden blanket. Ionia's father had already begun setting up his work area, laying out his tools and checking the edge of his axe blade one final time.

"Stay where I can see you," he called over his shoulder as Ionia slid down from Hoofbert's back. "And remember what your mother said about the basket!"

Ionia nodded, though her stomach growled so loudly she was sure even the birds could hear it. She found a comfortable spot on one of the stumps, setting the wicker basket beside her. The morning sun filtered through the canopy above, creating shifting patterns on the ground that reminded her of the lace on her mother's best tablecloth.

She watched as her father began work on a tall oak tree, his axe swinging in a steady rhythm that echoed through the woods. Each stroke was careful, purposeful – he never took more than the forest could spare, and always planted new seedlings in spring.

A flash of movement caught her eye – something small and quick darting between the stumps. Probably just another rabbit, she thought. But then she saw it again, closer this time. It wasn't a rabbit at all, but a creature about the size of a large rat, with bright eyes and a twitching nose. A pilferer! Just like in her mother's warnings!

Before Ionia could grab the basket, three more pilferers emerged from behind nearby stumps. They moved with astonishing speed, working together like a well-practiced pack. One scampered in circles, drawing her attention, while the others crept up behind her. By the time she realized what was happening, they had already snatched the basket and were darting away into the underbrush.

"Hey! Come back!" Ionia jumped up from her stump, her hunger forgotten in the excitement of the chase. "Father, the pilferers have our lunch!"

But the steady rhythm of his axe continued – the sound probably masked her voice. The pilferers were quick, but their short legs meant they had to work harder to navigate through the forest debris. She could just make out the wicker basket bobbing between them as they passed it back and forth like a game.

"Please stop!" she called after them, though this only seemed to encourage their game. They were taking turns carrying the basket now, their tails held high as they ran. Despite her frustration, Ionia couldn't help but admire their cleverness.

She was so focused on following the pilferers that she didn't notice how the forest was changing around her. The trees were growing closer together, their branches intertwining overhead until barely any sunlight reached the forest floor. The familiar sounds of her father's axe had faded away entirely, replaced by strange bird calls and the rustling of unseen creatures in the undergrowth.

Finally, the pilferers disappeared into a hollow log, taking her basket with them. Ionia dropped to her knees and peered into the dark opening, but she could see nothing inside. As she sat back on her heels, catching her breath, the reality of her situation slowly dawned on her.

The forest looked different here. The trees were older, their trunks twisted into strange shapes she'd never seen before. Thick vines hung from their branches like rope, and the air felt heavier, filled with unfamiliar scents of earth and decay and something else – something older and stranger than anything she'd known.

She turned in a circle, trying to spot something – anything – that might help her find her way back to the logging camp. But every direction looked the same. The trees seemed to watch her with hollow knots like eyes, and the branches creaked overhead though there was no wind.

For the first time since the chase began, Ionia felt a flutter of fear in her chest. She was lost in the deep woods, exactly where her mother had always warned her not to go. Worse still, she had no idea which way would lead her back to her father.

"Stay calm," she whispered to herself, remembering her father's teachings. "Look for signs you recognize."

But nothing here looked familiar. A twig snapped somewhere in the darkness beyond the trees, and Ionia froze. Something was moving out there, something much bigger than a pilferer. And as the shadows deepened around her, she realized that her mother's warnings about the forest's creatures hadn't been just stories after all.

# Chapter Three: First Signs

A patch of early morning fog had settled in the hollow, wrapping around the bases of the trees like a blanket. Through the mist, Ionia spotted what looked like a path – not the wide, muddy track they'd traveled that morning, but a narrow trail she hadn't noticed before. Ancient stones marked its edges, half-buried in earth and moss, their surfaces etched with patterns that time had almost worn away.

She took a few careful steps toward the path, remembering what her mother always said about staying still when lost. But the pilferers had her lunch, and her father would be worried when he discovered her missing. She couldn't just wait here forever.

"Which way?" she asked herself, studying the ground as her father had taught her. "Look for signs... there must be signs..."

The fog swirled around her ankles as she walked, making shapes that almost looked like dancing figures. Here and there, strange flowers grew between the marker stones – kinds she had never seen in the woods near home. Their petals were white as new snow, and they seemed to glow faintly in the dim light.

Something on the ground caught her eye. At first, she thought it was just another stone, but as she looked closer, she saw it was a hoofprint pressed into the soft earth. It was too small to be from Hoofbert, too delicate to be from a deer. And there was something odd about it – a silvery sheen that seemed to catch what little light filtered through the canopy above.

Ionia knelt down to look more closely. As she watched, a tiny white flower sprouted from the center of the print, unfurling its petals as if it had been growing for days instead of seconds. Her heart began to beat faster. She remembered the village children's stories about prints in the mud, about silvery hair caught on branches...

Following the direction of the print, she spotted another a few feet ahead. Then another. Each one held the same otherworldly gleam, and as she watched, more tiny flowers bloomed in their wake. They formed a path leading deeper into the forest, though these parts looked nothing like the woods she knew.

The trees here were ancient, their bark darker and more deeply furrowed than any she had seen before. Their branches reached toward each other overhead, weaving together so tightly that the morning sky was barely visible. Stone markers appeared more frequently along the trail, some standing as tall as Ionia herself, others tumbled and half-buried in the earth.

A cool breeze stirred the fog, carrying with it a strange, sweet scent she had never encountered before. The forest felt more awake here, more aware. Even the air seemed to tingle against her skin. When she breathed in deeply, she could almost taste something in the air – something that reminded her of starlight and winter frost and the way the world looked after fresh snow.

More hoofprints appeared ahead of her, their silvery gleam growing stronger. White flowers continued to sprout in their wake, creating a trail that seemed to glow in the forest's gloom. Whatever had made these prints had passed this way recently – very recently.

A sound drifted through the trees – not her father's axe or any bird she knew, but something like distant chimes or bells made of ice. It lasted only a moment before fading away, but it left Ionia with a certainty that she wasn't alone in this part of the forest.

Something was watching over her. She could feel it in the way the branches swayed, in the pattern of light and shadow on the ground, in the very air around her. Whatever it was felt neither threatening nor entirely safe – it was something older and stranger than either of those things.

"Father would say to be careful," she whispered to herself. "But he also says sometimes you have to trust what you know is right."

The trail of glowing hoofprints led onward, deeper into the ancient part of the forest. Ionia knew she should probably try to find her way back to the logging camp. But the prints seemed to call to her, promising something wonderful just ahead. And hadn't she always dreamed of finding something magical in these woods?

Taking a deep breath, she stepped forward, following the silvery trail. The white flowers bloomed beneath her feet, as if encouraging her onward. Whatever lay ahead, she felt sure it would be unlike anything she had ever known before.
