# Chapter Seven: The Elder's Wisdom

The forest grew older still as Ionia walked. The trees here were giants, their trunks wider than her family's cottage. Their branches reached so high she could barely see where they ended, twisting together overhead to create halls and archways that seemed to have been shaped by time itself.

Her father's boot prints had become harder to follow. The ground here was carpeted with thick moss and fallen leaves that held no tracks. Still, she pressed on, using other signs he had taught her – broken cobwebs between trees, recently disturbed leaves, the occasional scuffed bark where he might have steadied himself. The unicorn's silvery hoofprints still appeared now and then, though they seemed fainter in this ancient part of the forest, as if even its magic was humbled by what dwelt here.

Ionia stopped to rest beneath one of the ancient trees, her back against its massive trunk. As she sat there, catching her breath, she noticed something odd about the bark beneath her hands. It felt warm, almost alive, and seemed to pulse gently like a sleeping creature's breath.

She turned to look more closely at the tree. Its bark was deeply furrowed, creating patterns that almost looked like a face – if you used your imagination just right. There was a knot that might be an eye, a twisted groove that could be a mouth...

The bark moved.

Ionia scrambled to her feet, her heart pounding. The pattern in the bark was definitely changing, the grooves deepening and shifting until they formed a face as clear as any she had ever seen. It was ancient and wise, with eyes like deep pools of shadow and a mouth that might have been carved by centuries of wind and rain.

The Woodland Elder.

She knew it instantly, though it looked nothing like the scary monster from her mother's warnings. This being was part of the forest itself, as natural as moss on stones or leaves in the wind.

The Elder's eyes opened fully, fixing upon her with a gaze that seemed to look straight into her heart. Though its wooden lips didn't move, Ionia felt rather than heard its voice, like the whisper of wind through leaves or the creaking of branches in winter.

*Why have you come so deep, little one?*

The words formed in her mind as clearly as if they had been spoken aloud. Ionia swallowed hard before answering.

"I'm looking for my father," she said, her voice barely more than a whisper. "He's lost... or maybe I'm the one who's lost. I'm not sure anymore."

The Elder's face shifted slightly, bark creaking, and Ionia felt a wave of something wash over her – understanding, perhaps, or compassion. It reminded her of the way the unicorn had looked at her in the clearing.

*The forest knows its children,* came the thought-voice. *All who wander here are part of its story.*

"Have you seen my father?" Ionia asked hopefully. "He's a woodcutter, but he's careful with the trees. He only takes what's needed, and he always plants new seedlings in the spring."

The Elder's expression changed again, and this time Ionia felt something different – approval, mixed with a deep sadness that she didn't quite understand.

*Your father respects the old ways, even if he does not know them. And you, child... you see what others have forgotten how to see.*

As the Elder spoke in her mind, the forest around them seemed to come alive in a new way. Ionia noticed things she hadn't seen before – the intricate patterns of moss growing on the trees, the complex network of roots beneath her feet, the way the branches overhead moved together like dancers in an ancient, slow dance.

*The path you seek lies ahead,* the Elder continued, *but the journey is more than just finding what is lost. You have already begun to understand.*

"Understand what?" Ionia asked, but she could feel the Elder's presence fading. The face in the bark was becoming less distinct, the patterns shifting back to their natural state.

Just before it disappeared completely, one final thought drifted through her mind, as gentle as falling leaves:

*Trust what you have seen. Remember what you have felt. The forest speaks to those who listen.*

Then the face was gone, leaving only ordinary bark beneath Ionia's trembling fingers. But the forest around her felt different now – more alive, more aware. She noticed a path to her right that she hadn't seen before, marked by a line of small white flowers growing in a perfect curve between the trees.

As she started down this new path, Ionia realized something had changed inside her as well. The forest no longer seemed frightening. Instead, it felt like being wrapped in an enormous, ancient embrace – mysterious and wonderful, but no longer strange.

Evening was approaching, the light growing softer between the trees. Somewhere ahead, she caught a glimpse of silver-white moving through the gathering shadows. The unicorn was still with her, still guiding her forward. And now, with the Elder's wisdom in her heart, she felt ready for whatever magic lay ahead.
