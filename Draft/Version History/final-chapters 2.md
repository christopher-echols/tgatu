# Chapter Ten: Walking Between Worlds

The ember moths stayed with them as they left the wedding clearing, their warm light guiding the way through the nighttime forest. Ionia walked beside the unicorn now, no longer following behind. She felt different somehow – as if the wedding feast had awakened something in her, some deeper understanding of both the forest and herself.

The night was full of wonders she had never noticed before. Mushrooms glowed with a pale blue light along fallen logs. Night-blooming flowers released sweet scents into the cool air. Moonlight filtered through the canopy above, creating patches of silver on the forest floor that seemed to move and shift like water.

She still looked for signs of her father's passage, but now she noticed other things too – the way certain branches bent to mark safe paths, how moss grew thicker where the ground was sturdy, the subtle patterns in bark that told stories about the trees' long lives. The forest was speaking its own language, and she was beginning to understand it.

"I never knew the forest could be like this," she whispered to herself. "So full of stories, if you know how to read them."

They crossed a small stream where the water sang quiet songs over smooth stones. As Ionia carefully picked her way across, she noticed how the unicorn's hooves barely seemed to touch the water's surface. Light rippled out from each step, as if the creature walked on starlight rather than water.

On the other bank, they found fresh signs of her father's passage – a recently broken branch, a clear bootprint in soft earth. The trail was getting warmer. But something was changing in the forest around them. The ancient trees were beginning to thin, giving way to younger growth. The air felt different too, more like the woods near home.

The unicorn's steps grew hesitant. Several times it stopped completely, looking back the way they had come. Ionia noticed how its coat seemed to shine less brightly here, as if something about this part of the forest dimmed its magic.

She thought about the princess and her love, about choices and courage and following one's heart. The unicorn had led her through the deepest parts of the forest, shown her wonders she would never forget. But now she could sense that their journey together was coming to an end.

The ember moths seemed to understand this too. One by one, they began to drift away, returning to the deeper, more magical parts of the forest. Their light faded gradually, like sunset giving way to dusk, until only a few remained to light the path ahead.

# Chapter Eleven: The Heart's Farewell

The unicorn stopped at the stream's edge and would not step forward. Though no words passed between them, Ionia understood. This stream marked a boundary – not just between different parts of the forest, but between the magical realm she had walked through and the more ordinary world beyond.

"What's wrong?" she asked, though somehow she already knew. The princess's words echoed in her heart: *Sometimes the hardest part of any journey is trusting that you're strong enough to face it.*

The unicorn lowered its elegant head, touching its nose to the earth beside the stream. There, sprouting between its hooves, a small cluster of white flowers began to grow – the same kind that had marked their first meeting.

"You can't leave the forest, can you?" Ionia's voice was barely a whisper.

The unicorn's eyes met hers, filled with a gentle sadness. This deep connection they had formed, this friendship that had grown with each step of their journey together, had always been leading to this moment.

"But..." Ionia's throat felt tight. "How will I find him without you?"

The unicorn stepped closer, and for the first time, Ionia wrapped her arms around its strong neck. Its mane felt like cool silk against her cheek. As she held on, memories flooded through her mind: how she had learned to read the forest's signs, find courage in darkness, trust her own heart. She remembered the ember moths lighting her way, the whispering trees guiding her steps, and most of all, the growing certainty in her own abilities.

"I'm not the same girl who got lost chasing pilferers, am I?" she said softly.

The unicorn nickered – a sound so full of affection and pride that Ionia felt tears spring to her eyes.

"You've been teaching me all along," she realized. "How to trust myself. How to read the forest's signs. How to be brave even when I'm uncertain." She stepped back, wiping her eyes with the back of her hand. "And now I need to finish this journey on my own."

The unicorn dipped its head in confirmation. Then, to Ionia's amazement, it knelt before her, folding its legs gracefully until they were at eye level. In its gaze, she saw reflected all the magic and mystery of the forest, but also something else – a reminder of her own strength, her own magic.

"I won't tell anyone about you," she promised. "Well, except my father. He should know who helped guide his daughter back to him." She paused, then added, "But I don't think anyone else would understand. They'd want to come looking for you, to prove you exist. And that's not what magic is for, is it?"

The unicorn touched its horn gently to her forehead. In that moment, Ionia felt a warmth spread through her whole body, like sunshine after rain. She understood then that this wasn't really goodbye. The unicorn would always be part of the forest, and the forest would always be there, holding its mysteries for those wise enough to believe in them.

# Chapter Twelve: What Was Lost and Found

Straightening her shoulders, Ionia turned toward the stepping stones. Her father's tracks led clearly away into the woods beyond. Before crossing, she looked back one last time.

The unicorn stood tall and proud in the moonlight, its horn catching the starlight that filtered through the leaves above. As Ionia watched, a swirl of white petals rose from the flowers at its feet, dancing in the air around its silvery form. Then, like stardust scattering on a breeze, both the petals and the unicorn faded into the forest's shadows.

But Ionia didn't feel alone anymore. The forest had taught her its secrets, and she carried them in her heart. Taking a deep breath, she stepped onto the first stone.

The pre-dawn light was just beginning to touch the trees when she heard it – the familiar sound of an axe striking wood. Her heart leaped.

"Father!" she called out, her voice strong and sure.

The chopping stopped. A moment of silence, then: "Ionia? IONIA!"

She ran toward his voice, ducking under low branches and leaping over roots with a confidence she hadn't possessed that morning. There, in a small clearing ahead, stood her father. His clothes were dirty and torn, his face scratched from pushing through thorny bushes. The moment he saw her, he dropped his axe and ran to meet her, scooping her up in his strong arms.

"My brave girl," he whispered, holding her tight. "I've been searching everywhere for you."

"I've been searching for you too," Ionia said into his shoulder. She could feel him trembling, and realized he must have been just as scared as she had been.

When he finally set her down, they both started talking at once, their words tumbling over each other:

"I followed your tracks—"
"The pilferers took your lunch—"
"I found signs you'd passed—"
"Been looking since yesterday—"

They looked at each other and laughed, the sound echoing through the trees like music.

"You must tell me everything," her father said, keeping hold of her hand as if afraid she might disappear again. "How did you survive out here alone? How did you find your way?"

Ionia thought carefully before answering. "I wasn't exactly alone," she said. "The forest... helped me."

Her father's eyes widened slightly. "The forest helped you?"

"Yes," she said firmly. "And father... I saw it. The unicorn. It's real."

She waited for him to laugh, to tell her she must have imagined it. Instead, he knelt down and looked into her eyes with an expression she had never seen before – wonder mixed with something like recognition.

"When I was very young," he said slowly, "younger than you are now... I saw something in these woods. Something magical. But when I told the grown-ups, they said I was just telling stories." He squeezed her hand. "I stopped believing in what I'd seen. But maybe... maybe I should have held onto that belief."

Together, they gathered his tools and began the long walk back to the logging camp. As they walked, Ionia told him everything – about learning to read the forest's signs, about the secret wedding blessed by ember moths, and most of all, about the unicorn who had guided her, taught her, and become her friend.

Her father listened without interrupting, and Ionia could see in his eyes that he believed every word. Sometimes he would nod, as if her stories explained mysteries he had glimpsed himself over his many years in the forest.

When they reached the logging camp, they found faithful Hoofbert waiting patiently beside the cart, exactly where they had left her. The old mule's ears perked up at their approach, and she bumped her nose against Ionia's shoulder in greeting.

The journey home seemed shorter than Ionia remembered. As their cart bumped along the forest track, she watched the shadows between the trees, thinking about all she had learned. Though the unicorn didn't appear again, she felt its presence in every shaft of sunlight, every unexpected flower blooming beside the path.

Her mother was working in her workshop when they arrived, but she came running at the sound of the cart. There were tears and hugs, scoldings and relieved laughter. That evening, they sat together by the big fireplace while Ionia told her story once more.

"The forest is different than we thought," she explained to her mother. "The creatures in your warnings – they're real, but they're not all dangerous. They're part of something wonderful."

Her mother shared a look with her father. "Perhaps," she said thoughtfully, "I've been telling the wrong kinds of stories."

From that day forward, things changed in subtle ways around their little cottage. Her mother's warnings about the forest became less fearful and more respectful. Her father always seemed to know exactly which trees to cut and which to leave standing, as if the forest itself was guiding his choices.

And sometimes, on quiet evenings, Ionia would walk to the edge of the forest alone. There, she would sing their old woodcutter's song, adding quiet verses about silver manes and ancient trees, about ember moths and secret weddings, about the courage to believe in wonderful things.

And sometimes, if she listened very carefully, she could hear the forest singing back.
