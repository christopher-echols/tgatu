# Chapter Four: A Glimpse of Magic

The path led Ionia to a clearing where the fog parted like a curtain. Shafts of sunlight broke through the dense canopy overhead. The air here felt different, clearer somehow. Her legs ached from running, and her stomach reminded her sharply of the lost lunch. She sank down on a fallen log to catch her breath.

"Father always says to stay put when you're lost," she whispered to herself, her voice sounding small in the strange forest. "But he also says to look for signs you recognize..."

That's when she saw it – there, between the trees at the far edge of the clearing. A flash of silver-white, like moonlight given form.

Her heart beat faster as she watched it move with impossible grace. She caught a glimpse of a spiraling horn that seemed to gather all the scattered bits of sunlight. Could it really be?

The unicorn.

But even as the thought formed in her mind, the creature moved deeper into the shadows. Ionia took a hesitant step forward, then another. "Wait," she whispered, though she wasn't sure if she should speak at all. "Please..."

At the edge of the clearing, the unicorn paused. Through the trees, Ionia could make out its profile, proud and elegant. It turned its head slightly, and for just a moment, their eyes met. The unicorn's gaze was deep and knowing, filled with an ancient wisdom that made her feel both small and safe at the same time. Something in those eyes reminded her of the way her father looked at the forest – with respect, understanding, and love.

Then it moved forward, not exactly leading but somehow showing the way. Ionia followed, noticing how the unicorn's path seemed to take the easiest routes between trees, around thorny bushes, past fallen logs that were simple to climb. It was teaching her to read the forest, just as her father did.

When she finally stumbled into the logging camp, her heart sank. The clearing was empty. Her father's tools were gone, and the golden sawdust had been disturbed by searching feet. But there, still harnessed to the cart where they'd left her, stood Hoofbert.

"Hoofbert!" Ionia ran to the mule, throwing her arms around the sturdy neck. "Have you seen where Father went? Which way did he go?"

The mule's warm breath stirred her hair, but of course, there was no answer. Still, the familiar presence helped calm Ionia's racing heart. She studied the ground around the cart, remembering her father's lessons about tracking.

"Look for the freshest signs," she whispered, mimicking his teaching voice. "See how these prints are on top of others? They're the newest."

Her father's boot prints showed a clear pattern – he had started searching in a spiral, checking every direction. He would have called for her. How had she not heard him? But she had been so focused on the pilferers, and then the unicorn...

A movement caught her eye – that same flash of silver-white at the edge of her vision. But when she turned to look, there was nothing there. Only then did Ionia realize what had happened. The unicorn hadn't just appeared to her; it had led her back to the camp, watching over her the whole way.

Standing there in the abandoned logging camp, Ionia felt something shift inside her. She had seen something magical – not just the unicorn itself, but a glimpse of the forest's true nature. And somehow, despite her fear and confusion, she knew this was only the beginning.

# Chapter Five: The Deepening Wood

As the afternoon shadows lengthened across the empty logging camp, Ionia tried to think like her father. He wouldn't have given up searching for her. But he also wouldn't have stayed in one place – he would have gone looking, just as she had done when chasing the pilferers.

Her legs were tired, and her empty stomach made it hard to think. But father had taught her well, even if she hadn't known she was learning at the time. She studied the disturbed sawdust around his work area, remembering his lessons.

"Tracks tell stories," she murmured, tracing the patterns with her eyes. "See how deep these prints are? He was walking fast here, worried."

There – just at the edge of the clearing, she spotted something promising: a broken twig at just the height her father's shoulder would brush past. Following this first sign, she found others: a scraped patch of bark where he might have steadied himself, some scattered leaves where heavy boots had passed.

"I can do this," she told herself firmly. "Father taught me how to follow tracks. These are his boots, I'm sure of it."

She pressed deeper into the forest, which grew older and stranger with each step. The trees here were massive, their trunks wider than her family's cottage. Their branches reached so high she could barely see where they ended, and their roots created great archways above the ground, like doorways to hidden places.

A strange sound stopped her in her tracks – a deep, rumbling snuffle that seemed to come from just ahead. Ionia froze, remembering her mother's warnings about muck-mucks. The sound came again, closer this time, followed by the crack of breaking branches.

Through a gap in the vegetation, she caught a glimpse of something large moving through the undergrowth. It had bristly brown fur and curved tusks that gleamed dully in the filtered sunlight. A real muck-muck! The creature was even bigger than she had imagined, with a broad, flat nose that moved constantly as it sniffed the ground.

Ionia's heart pounded. The muck-muck was between her and where she thought her father's trail led. She looked around frantically for somewhere to hide, remembering how her father had once taught her that staying still was often better than running.

There – a hollow space beneath the roots of a nearby tree. She crept toward it as quietly as she could, stepping exactly where her father had shown her to place her feet to move silently through the forest. She had barely concealed herself when the muck-muck crashed past her hiding place, close enough that she could smell its musty fur and hear its heavy breathing.

For a long moment, nothing moved. Then, with a dismissive snort, the muck-muck turned and crashed away through the undergrowth, heading deeper into the forest.

Ionia let out her breath slowly. Her legs were shaking, but she felt oddly proud of herself. She had seen a real muck-muck – something even most grown-ups never managed – and she had kept her head just as her father would have done.

"One step at a time," she whispered to herself, using her father's words for when they carried heavy logs. "Just like Father says. One step, then another."

# Chapter Six: Reading the Forest's Signs

The afternoon light slanted golden through the trees as Ionia pressed onward. Her father's trail was growing fresher – here a recently snapped twig, there the clear impression of his boot in a patch of mud. But the forest itself was growing stranger. The trees seemed to lean inward as she passed, their ancient branches creaking softly overhead like whispered conversations.

She paused to catch her breath beside a fallen log. The forest was different here than anywhere she had been before. Even the shadows seemed deeper, as if they held memories of their own.

"Which way?" she asked herself, studying the ground. Two paths led forward – one going northeast, following a game trail, the other heading more directly north through denser growth.

She thought carefully about what her father had taught her. Game trails were easier to walk, but they meandered. Her father would have taken the direct route, wanting to cover more ground quickly in his search.

Sure enough, when she checked the northern path, she found signs of his passage – a fresh boot print, a broken spider web between trees. Her growing confidence in reading these signs felt like a warm glow in her chest.

As she walked, Ionia began to notice things she hadn't seen before – the way certain branches bent to make natural archways, how patches of moss grew thicker where the ground might be muddy, the careful placement of stones that made perfect stepping places across wet areas. It was as if the forest itself was helping to guide her, or as if she was finally learning to read its language.

The sun was sinking lower, and her shadow stretched long before her. She should have been frightened of the approaching darkness, but somehow she wasn't. Every step forward felt right, as if she was exactly where she needed to be.

A familiar flash of silver-white caught her eye, there and gone so quickly she might have imagined it. But she didn't need to see the unicorn clearly anymore to understand. Just as her father had taught her to read the forest's everyday signs, the unicorn had shown her there was more to learn, more to understand.

She straightened her shoulders and pressed on. The forest had taught her its secrets, both magical and mundane, and she carried them in her heart. Together with her father's practical lessons, they would guide her home.

Through a gap in the trees ahead, she caught a glimpse of movement – something large, but moving with purpose. Her heart leaped. Could it be? She quickened her pace, hope giving her tired legs new strength.

"Father?" she called softly, then louder: "Father!"
