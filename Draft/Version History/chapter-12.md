# Chapter Twelve: What Was Lost

The stepping stones led Ionia to a part of the forest she hadn't seen before. Ancient oaks grew so close together their trunks seemed to merge, creating natural archways draped with curtains of moss. Her father's tracks remained clear in the soft earth – he had passed this way not long ago.

As she walked, Ionia found herself humming their woodcutter's song. But this time, she made up new words:

Through the forest deep I roam,
Following tracks that lead me home,
Magic seen and lessons learned,
Now it's time that I returned.

A branch snapped in the distance. Ionia froze, listening intently. Then she heard it – the rhythmic sound of an axe striking wood. Her heart leaped.

"Father!" she called out, her voice strong and sure.

The chopping stopped. A moment of silence, then: "Ionia? IONIA!"

She ran toward his voice, ducking under low branches and leaping over roots with a confidence she hadn't possessed that morning. There, in a small clearing ahead, stood her father. His clothes were dirty and torn, his face scratched from pushing through thorny bushes. The moment he saw her, he dropped his axe and ran to meet her, scooping her up in his strong arms.

"My brave girl," he whispered, holding her tight. "I've been searching everywhere for you."

"I've been searching for you too," Ionia said into his shoulder. She could feel him trembling, and realized he must have been just as scared as she had been.

When he finally set her down, they both started talking at once, their words tumbling over each other:

"I followed your tracks—"
"The pilferers took your lunch—"
"I found signs you'd passed—"
"Been looking since yesterday—"

They looked at each other and laughed, the sound echoing through the trees like music.

"You must tell me everything," her father said, keeping hold of her hand as if afraid she might disappear again. "How did you survive out here alone? How did you find your way?"

Ionia thought carefully before answering. "I wasn't exactly alone," she said. "The forest... helped me."

Her father's eyes widened slightly. "The forest helped you?"

"Yes," she said firmly. "And father... I saw it. The unicorn. It's real."

She waited for him to laugh, to tell her she must have imagined it. Instead, he knelt down and looked into her eyes with an expression she had never seen before – wonder mixed with something like recognition.

"When I was very young," he said slowly, "younger than you are now... I saw something in these woods. Something magical. But when I told the grown-ups, they said I was just telling stories." He squeezed her hand. "I stopped believing in what I'd seen. But maybe... maybe I should have held onto that belief."

Ionia hugged him again, her heart full of joy. Not only had she found her father, but she had helped him find something he had lost long ago – the ability to believe in magic.

Together, they gathered his tools and began the long walk back to the logging camp. As they walked, Ionia told him everything – about her encounter with the Woodland Elder who spoke without words, about the secret wedding in the forest blessed by ember moths, and most of all, about the unicorn who had guided her, taught her, and become her friend.

Her father listened without interrupting, and Ionia could see in his eyes that he believed every word. Sometimes he would nod, as if her stories explained mysteries he had glimpsed himself over his many years in the forest.

"You're different," he said finally, looking at her with pride. "Stronger. More sure of yourself."

"The forest taught me things," Ionia replied. "About believing in myself. About trusting what I know is true, even when others might doubt it."

Her father smiled, and in that smile Ionia saw understanding – not just of her words, but of the magic that had always lived in these woods, waiting for those who were ready to see it.
