# Chapter Two: The Chase Begins

The logging camp was little more than a clearing where several large trees had been felled. Thick stumps dotted the ground like giant's teeth, and sawdust carpeted the forest floor in a golden blanket. Ionia's father had already begun setting up his work area, laying out his tools and checking the edge of his axe blade one final time.

"Stay where I can see you," he called over his shoulder as Ionia slid down from Hoofbert's back. "And remember what your mother said about the basket!"

Ionia nodded, though her stomach growled so loudly she was sure even the birds could hear it. She found a comfortable spot on one of the stumps, setting the wicker basket beside her. The morning sun filtered through the canopy above, creating shifting patterns on the ground that reminded her of the lace on her mother's best tablecloth. She watched as her father began work on a tall oak tree, his axe swinging in a steady rhythm that echoed through the woods.

A flash of movement caught her eye – something small and quick darting between the stumps. Probably just another rabbit, she thought. But then she saw it again, closer this time. It wasn't a rabbit at all, but a creature about the size of a large rat, with clever eyes and tiny hands that looked almost human. A pilferer! Just like in her mother's warnings!

Before Ionia could grab the basket, three more pilferers emerged from behind nearby stumps. They moved with astonishing speed, working together like a well-practiced team. One distracted her by performing a series of impressive backflips, while another snuck up behind her. By the time she realized what was happening, the third and fourth pilferers had already snatched the basket and were scampering away into the underbrush.

"Hey! Come back!" Ionia jumped up from her stump, her hunger forgotten in the excitement of the chase. The pilferers were quick, but their short legs meant they had to work harder to navigate through the forest debris. She could just make out the wicker basket bobbing between them as they passed it back and forth like a game.

Her father's axe continued its steady rhythm behind her as she pursued the thieves deeper into the woods. The pilferers chittered and squeaked, almost as if they were laughing at her. They led her through patches of purple flowers like the ones they'd passed earlier, around massive tree trunks, and over fallen logs covered in soft green moss.

"Please stop!" she called after them, but this only seemed to encourage their game. They were taking turns carrying the basket now, showing off with little jumps and spins as they ran. Despite her frustration, Ionia couldn't help but admire their playful grace.

She was so focused on following the pilferers that she didn't notice how the forest was changing around her. The trees were growing closer together, their branches intertwining overhead until barely any sunlight reached the forest floor. The familiar sounds of her father's axe had faded away entirely, replaced by strange bird calls and the rustling of unseen creatures in the undergrowth.

Finally, the pilferers disappeared into a hollow log, taking her basket with them. Ionia dropped to her knees and peered into the dark opening, but she could see nothing inside. As she sat back on her heels, catching her breath, the reality of her situation slowly dawned on her.

The forest looked different here. The trees were older, their trunks twisted into strange shapes she'd never seen before. Thick vines hung from their branches like rope, and the air felt heavier, filled with unfamiliar scents of earth and decay and something else – something older and stranger than anything she'd known.

She turned in a circle, trying to spot something – anything – that might help her find her way back to the logging camp. But every direction looked the same. The trees seemed to watch her with hollow knots like eyes, and the branches creaked overhead though there was no wind.

For the first time since the chase began, Ionia felt a flutter of fear in her chest. She was lost in the deep woods, exactly where her mother had always warned her not to go. Worse still, she had no idea which way would lead her back to her father.

A twig snapped somewhere in the darkness beyond the trees, and Ionia froze. Something was moving out there, something much bigger than a pilferer. And as the shadows deepened around her, she realized that her mother's warnings about the forest's creatures hadn't been just stories after all.
