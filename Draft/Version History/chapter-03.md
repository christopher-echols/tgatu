# Chapter Three: First Signs

A patch of early morning fog had settled in the hollow, wrapping around the bases of the trees like a blanket. Through the mist, Ionia spotted what looked like a path – not the wide, muddy track they'd traveled that morning, but a narrow trail she hadn't noticed before. Ancient stones marked its edges, half-buried in earth and moss, their surfaces etched with patterns she didn't recognize.

She took a few careful steps toward the path, remembering what her mother always said about staying still when lost. But the pilferers had her lunch, and her father would be worried when he discovered her missing. She couldn't just wait here forever.

The fog swirled around her ankles as she walked, making shapes that almost looked like dancing figures. Here and there, strange flowers grew between the marker stones – kinds she had never seen in the woods near home. Their petals were white as new snow, and they seemed to glow faintly in the dim light.

Something on the ground caught her eye. At first, she thought it was just another stone, but as she looked closer, she saw it was a hoofprint pressed into the soft earth. It was too small to be from Hoofbert, too delicate to be from a deer. And there was something odd about it – a silvery sheen that seemed to catch what little light filtered through the canopy above.

Ionia knelt down to look more closely. As she watched, a tiny white flower sprouted from the center of the print, unfurling its petals as if it had been growing for days instead of seconds. Her heart began to beat faster. She remembered the village children's stories about prints in the mud, about silvery hair caught on branches...

Following the direction of the print, she spotted another a few feet ahead. Then another. Each one held the same otherworldly gleam, and as she watched, more tiny flowers bloomed in their wake. They formed a path leading deeper into the forest, though these parts looked nothing like the woods she knew.

The trees here were ancient, their bark darker and more deeply furrowed than any she had seen before. Their branches reached toward each other overhead, weaving together so tightly that the morning sky was barely visible. Stone markers appeared more frequently along the trail, some standing as tall as Ionia herself, others tumbled and half-buried in the earth.

A cool breeze stirred the fog, carrying with it a strange, sweet scent she had never encountered before. The forest felt more awake here, more aware. Even the air seemed to tingle against her skin. When she breathed in deeply, she could almost taste something in the air – something that reminded her of starlight and winter frost and the way the world looked after fresh snow.

More hoofprints appeared ahead of her, their silvery gleam growing stronger. White flowers continued to sprout in their wake, creating a trail that seemed to glow in the forest's gloom. Whatever had made these prints had passed this way recently – very recently.

A sound drifted through the trees – not her father's axe or any bird she knew, but something like distant chimes or bells made of ice. It lasted only a moment before fading away, but it left Ionia with a certainty that she wasn't alone in this part of the forest.

Something was watching over her. She could feel it in the way the branches swayed, in the pattern of light and shadow on the ground, in the very air around her. Whatever it was felt neither threatening nor entirely safe – it was something older and stranger than either of those things.

The trail of glowing hoofprints led onward, deeper into the ancient part of the forest. Ionia knew she should probably try to find her way back to the logging camp. But the prints seemed to call to her, promising something wonderful just ahead. And hadn't she always dreamed of finding something magical in these woods?

Taking a deep breath, she stepped forward, following the silvery trail. The white flowers bloomed beneath her feet, as if encouraging her onward. Whatever lay ahead, she felt sure it would be unlike anything she had ever known before.
