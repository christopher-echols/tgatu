# Chapter Thirteen: Songs of the Forest

When they reached the logging camp, they found Hoofbert waiting patiently beside the cart, exactly where her father had left her. The old mule's ears perked up at their approach, and she bumped her nose against Ionia's shoulder in greeting.

"She wouldn't leave," her father explained. "Almost as if she knew we'd come back here."

Ionia stroked Hoofbert's neck, thinking of all she had learned about trust and patience. "She's wiser than we knew," she said softly.

The journey home seemed shorter than Ionia remembered. As their cart bumped along the forest track, she watched the shadows between the trees, half-expecting to catch a glimpse of silver-white among the leaves. Though the unicorn didn't appear, she felt its presence in every shaft of sunlight, every unexpected flower blooming beside the path.

Her mother was working in her workshop when they arrived, but she came running at the sound of the cart. There were tears and hugs, scoldings and relieved laughter. That evening, they sat together by the big fireplace while Ionia told her story once more.

"The forest is different than we thought," she explained to her mother. "The creatures in your warnings – they're real, but they're not all dangerous. They're part of the magic that lives there, and if you respect them, they might even help you."

Her mother shared a look with her father. "Perhaps," she said thoughtfully, "I've been telling the wrong kinds of stories."

From that day forward, things changed in subtle ways around their little cottage. Her mother's warnings about the forest became less fearful and more respectful. Her father always seemed to know exactly which trees to cut and which to leave standing, as if the forest itself was guiding his choices.

And sometimes, on quiet evenings, they would sit together and make up new verses to the woodcutter's song. Ionia taught them the one she had made up while searching for her father, and soon they were all adding verses about magic and friendship, about courage and trust. The song grew longer and richer, like the forest itself, full of mysteries and wonder.

Ionia often returned to the forest with her father. Though she never again ventured as deep as she had during her adventure, she always felt welcome among the ancient trees. Sometimes, she would catch a hint of movement just at the edge of her vision, or hear what might have been the distant sound of hooves on soft earth. In those moments, she would smile, remembering the unicorn's final lesson – that the truest magic lives not in what we can prove to others, but in what we know in our hearts to be real.

On special days, when the light slanted just right through the trees and the wind carried scents of far-off places, Ionia would walk to the edge of the forest alone. There, she would sing their woodcutter's song, adding quiet verses about silver manes and ancient trees, about ember moths and secret weddings, about the courage to believe in wonderful things.

And sometimes, if she listened very carefully, she could hear the forest singing back.
