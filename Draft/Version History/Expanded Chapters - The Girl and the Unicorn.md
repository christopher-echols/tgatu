# Chapter Five: The Deepening Wood

As the afternoon shadows lengthened across the empty logging camp, Ionia tried to think like her father. He wouldn't have given up searching for her. But he also wouldn't have stayed in one place – he would have gone looking, just as she had done when chasing the pilferers.

Her legs were tired, and her empty stomach made it hard to think. But father had taught her well, even if she hadn't known she was learning at the time. She studied the disturbed sawdust around his work area, remembering his lessons.

"Tracks tell stories," she murmured, tracing the patterns with her eyes. "See how deep these prints are? He was walking fast here, worried."

There – just at the edge of the clearing, she spotted something promising: a broken twig at just the height her father's shoulder would brush past. Following this first sign, she found others: a scraped patch of bark where he might have steadied himself, some scattered leaves where heavy boots had passed.

"I can do this," she told herself firmly. "Father taught me how to follow tracks. These are his boots, I'm sure of it."

She pressed deeper into the forest, which grew older and stranger with each step. The trees here were massive, their trunks wider than her family's cottage. Their branches reached so high she could barely see where they ended, and their roots created great archways above the ground, like doorways to hidden places.

A strange sound stopped her in her tracks – a deep, rumbling snuffle that seemed to come from just ahead. Ionia froze, remembering her mother's warnings about muck-mucks. The sound came again, closer this time, followed by the crack of breaking branches.

Through a gap in the vegetation, she caught a glimpse of something large moving through the undergrowth. It had bristly brown fur and curved tusks that gleamed dully in the filtered sunlight. A real muck-muck! The creature was even bigger than she had imagined, with a broad, flat nose that moved constantly as it sniffed the ground.

Ionia's heart pounded. The muck-muck was between her and where she thought her father's trail led. She looked around frantically for somewhere to hide, remembering how her father had once taught her that staying still was often better than running.

There – a hollow space beneath the roots of a nearby tree. She crept toward it as quietly as she could, stepping exactly where her father had shown her to place her feet to move silently through the forest. She had barely concealed herself when the muck-muck crashed past her hiding place, close enough that she could smell its musty fur and hear its heavy breathing.

For a long moment, nothing moved. Then, with a dismissive snort, the muck-muck turned and crashed away through the undergrowth, heading deeper into the forest.

Ionia let out her breath slowly. Her legs were shaking, but she felt oddly proud of herself. She had seen a real muck-muck – something even most grown-ups never managed – and she had kept her head just as her father would have done.

"One step at a time," she whispered to herself, using her father's words for when they carried heavy logs. "Just like Father says. One step, then another."

But as she emerged from her hiding place, something made her pause. The tree she had sheltered beneath felt... different. Its bark was warm beneath her hands, almost alive, and seemed to pulse gently like a sleeping creature's breath.

# Chapter Six: The Elder's Wisdom

Ionia turned to look more closely at the tree. Its bark was deeply furrowed, creating patterns that almost looked like a face – if you used your imagination just right. There was a knot that might be an eye, a twisted groove that could be a mouth...

The bark moved.

She scrambled back, her heart pounding. The pattern in the bark was definitely changing, the grooves deepening and shifting until they formed a face as clear as any she had ever seen. It was ancient and wise, with eyes like deep pools of shadow and a mouth that might have been carved by centuries of wind and rain.

The Woodland Elder.

She knew it instantly, though it looked nothing like the scary monster from her mother's warnings. This being was part of the forest itself, as natural as moss on stones or leaves in the wind.

The Elder's eyes opened fully, fixing upon her with a gaze that seemed to look straight into her heart. Though its wooden lips didn't move, Ionia felt rather than heard its voice, like the whisper of wind through leaves or the creaking of branches in winter.

*Why have you come so deep, little one?*

The words formed in her mind as clearly as if they had been spoken aloud. Ionia swallowed hard before answering.

"I'm looking for my father," she said, her voice barely more than a whisper. "He's lost... or maybe I'm the one who's lost. I'm not sure anymore."

The Elder's face shifted slightly, bark creaking, and Ionia felt a wave of something wash over her – understanding, perhaps, or compassion. It reminded her of the way her father looked at the forest when he thought no one was watching.

*The forest knows its children,* came the thought-voice. *All who wander here are part of its story.*

"Have you seen my father?" Ionia asked hopefully. "He's a woodcutter, but he's careful with the trees. He only takes what's needed, and he always plants new seedlings in spring."

The Elder's expression changed again, and this time Ionia felt something different – approval, mixed with a deep sadness that she didn't quite understand.

*Your father respects the old ways, even if he does not know them. And you, child... you see what others have forgotten how to see.*

As the Elder spoke in her mind, the forest around them seemed to come alive in a new way. Ionia noticed things she hadn't seen before – the intricate patterns of moss growing on the trees, the complex network of roots beneath her feet, the way the branches overhead moved together like dancers in an ancient, slow dance.

*The path you seek lies ahead,* the Elder continued, *but the journey is more than just finding what is lost. You have already begun to understand.*

"Understand what?" Ionia asked, but she could feel the Elder's presence fading. The face in the bark was becoming less distinct, the patterns shifting back to their natural state.

Just before it disappeared completely, one final thought drifted through her mind, as gentle as falling leaves:

*Trust what you have seen. Remember what you have felt. The forest speaks to those who listen.*

Then the face was gone, leaving only ordinary bark beneath Ionia's trembling fingers. But the forest around her felt different now – more alive, more aware. She noticed a path to her right that she hadn't seen before, marked by a line of small white flowers growing in a perfect curve between the trees.

As she started down this new path, Ionia realized something had changed inside her as well. The forest no longer seemed frightening. Instead, it felt like being wrapped in an enormous, ancient embrace – mysterious and wonderful, but no longer strange.

# Chapter Seven: Reading the Forest's Signs

The afternoon light slanted golden through the trees as Ionia pressed onward. Her father's trail was growing fresher – here a recently snapped twig, there the clear impression of his boot in a patch of mud. But the forest itself was growing stranger. The trees seemed to lean inward as she passed, their ancient branches creaking softly overhead like whispered conversations.

She paused to catch her breath beside a fallen log. The forest was different here than anywhere she had been before. Even the shadows seemed deeper, as if they held memories of their own. After meeting the Elder, she could almost imagine those memories – centuries of seasons changing, of creatures passing, of stories unfolding beneath these ancient boughs.

"Which way?" she asked herself, studying the ground. Two paths led forward – one going northeast, following a game trail, the other heading more directly north through denser growth.

She thought carefully about what her father had taught her, and what the Elder had shown her about seeing with more than just her eyes. Game trails were easier to walk, but they meandered. Her father would have taken the direct route, wanting to cover more ground quickly in his search.

Sure enough, when she checked the northern path, she found signs of his passage – a fresh boot print, a broken spider web between trees. Her growing confidence in reading these signs felt like a warm glow in her chest, like the Elder's approval when she spoke of her father's respect for the forest.

As she walked, Ionia began to notice things she hadn't seen before – the way certain branches bent to make natural archways, how patches of moss grew thicker where the ground might be muddy, the careful placement of stones that made perfect stepping places across wet areas. It was as if the forest itself was helping to guide her, or as if she was finally learning to read its language.

The sun was sinking lower, and her shadow stretched long before her. She should have been frightened of the approaching darkness, but somehow she wasn't. The Elder's words echoed in her mind: *The forest speaks to those who listen.* Every step forward felt right, as if she was exactly where she needed to be.

A familiar flash of silver-white caught her eye, there and gone so quickly she might have imagined it. But she didn't need to see the unicorn clearly anymore to understand. Just as her father had taught her to read the forest's everyday signs, and the Elder had shown her its deeper magic, the unicorn had been teaching her to trust her own heart's wisdom all along.

She straightened her shoulders and pressed on. The forest had taught her its secrets, both magical and mundane, and she carried them in her heart. Together with her father's practical lessons and the Elder's ancient wisdom, they would guide her home.

Through a gap in the trees ahead, she caught a glimpse of movement – something large, but moving with purpose. Her heart leaped. Could it be? She quickened her pace, hope giving her tired legs new strength.

"Father?" she called softly, then louder: "Father!"
