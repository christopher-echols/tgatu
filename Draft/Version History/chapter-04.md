# Chapter Four: A Glimpse of Magic

The path led Ionia to a clearing where the fog parted like a curtain. Shafts of sunlight broke through the dense canopy overhead, illuminating a carpet of tiny white flowers – the same kind that had bloomed in the mysterious hoofprints. The air here felt different, clearer somehow, as if she had stepped into a place where the world itself held its breath.

And there, between the trees at the far edge of the clearing, she saw something that made her own breath catch in her throat.

A flash of silver-white, like moonlight given form.

It moved with impossible grace, barely disturbing the flowers beneath its hooves. Ionia caught a glimpse of a spiraling horn that seemed to gather all the scattered bits of sunlight. Her heart beat faster – could it really be?

The unicorn.

But even as the thought formed in her mind, the creature moved deeper into the shadows. Ionia took a hesitant step forward, then another. The white flowers bent away from her feet, creating tiny paths through the clearing.

"Wait," she whispered, though she wasn't sure if she should speak at all. "Please..."

At the edge of the clearing, the unicorn paused. Through the trees, Ionia could make out its profile, proud and elegant. It turned its head slightly, and for just a moment, she thought she saw its eye – deep and knowing, filled with an ancient wisdom that made her feel both small and safe at the same time.

Then it was gone, disappearing into the forest like morning mist.

Ionia stood alone in the clearing, wondering if she had imagined it all. But there, where the unicorn had stood, a new path opened through the undergrowth. The white stones that marked it seemed to shine a little brighter than the ones that had led her here.

She glanced back the way she had come, but that path had somehow vanished among the trees. Forward was her only choice now.

As Ionia followed the new path, she occasionally caught glimpses of something white moving through the trees ahead. Sometimes it was just a flash between trunks, other times a distant figure half-hidden by fog. Each time she tried to get a better look, it would vanish, only to appear again further along the path.

The forest began to feel less frightening, though Ionia couldn't say why. Perhaps it was the way the path seemed to choose itself, steering her around thorny bushes and past fallen logs that were easy to climb. Or maybe it was the sense that she wasn't entirely alone anymore.

She noticed things she hadn't seen before – the way certain branches bent to make natural archways, how patches of moss grew thicker where the ground might be muddy, the careful placement of stones that made perfect stepping places across wet areas. It was as if the forest itself was helping to guide her, or as if something was showing her the safest way through.

When she finally stumbled into the logging camp, her heart sank. The clearing was empty. Her father's tools were gone, and so was Hoofbert with the cart. Even the golden sawdust had been disturbed by searching feet.

"He's not here," she said, her voice small in the empty clearing.

A movement caught her eye – that same flash of silver-white at the edge of her vision. But when she turned to look, there was nothing there. Only then did Ionia realize what had happened. The unicorn hadn't just appeared to her; it had led her back to the camp, watching over her the whole way.

Standing there in the abandoned logging camp, Ionia felt something shift inside her. She had seen something magical – not just the unicorn itself, but a glimpse of the forest's true nature. And somehow, despite her fear and confusion, she knew this was only the beginning.

"Thank you," she whispered to the empty air, and for just a moment, she thought she heard the forest whisper back.
