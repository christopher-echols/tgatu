# Chapter Eight: Shadows and Starlight

The sun was setting, turning the forest into a maze of deepening shadows. Ionia knew she should be frightened – her mother had always warned her never to be in the deep woods after dark. But something had changed since her meeting with the Woodland Elder. The darkness felt different here, more like a soft blanket settling over the forest than something to fear.

Still, it was getting harder to see the signs she had been following. Her father's trail was barely visible in the fading light, and even the unicorn's silvery hoofprints seemed dimmer. The white flowers that had helped guide her way were closing their petals for the night.

Just as Ionia was wondering if she should try to find a safe place to wait until morning, she noticed something unusual. At first, she thought she was seeing the last gleams of sunlight caught in spider webs. But these lights were moving, drifting through the air like tiny, glowing embers.

One floated closer, and she saw it wasn't a spark at all, but a moth. Its wings shimmered with a warm, copper light, as if it had captured sunset in its delicate patterns. Another appeared, then another, until the darkening forest was filled with their gentle radiance.

The ember moths seemed to be gathering around her, their light casting a warm glow that made it easier to see the path ahead. As they danced through the air, Ionia noticed how their wings pulsed with light – brightening and dimming like slow heartbeats. The effect was mesmerizing, almost like music made visible.

A familiar flash of silver-white caught her eye – the unicorn, its coat gleaming in the moths' light. It stood at the edge of a path Ionia hadn't noticed before, waiting. When it was sure she had seen it, the unicorn stepped forward into the darkness. The ember moths followed, their light creating a corridor through the night-dark forest.

Ionia followed too, watching in wonder as more ember moths emerged from the shadows to join the others. Their combined light revealed a forest transformed by darkness. Night-blooming flowers opened their petals, releasing sweet perfumes into the air. Luminous fungi grew in clusters on the trees, adding their pale blue-green glow to the moths' warmer light.

The path led upward, winding between ancient trees whose trunks were wrapped in phosphorescent vines. The higher they climbed, the more ember moths appeared, until the air was filled with their gentle light. Their wings created patterns of shadow and radiance that seemed to tell stories Ionia could almost understand.

At the top of the rise, the unicorn paused. Ahead, Ionia could hear something – music unlike anything she had ever heard before. It reminded her of crystal wind chimes and summer rain and the sound snow makes when it falls in the deepest part of winter. The ember moths' wings pulsed in rhythm with the ethereal melody.

The unicorn moved forward again, leading her toward the music. As they crested the hill, Ionia caught her breath at what lay before them. A natural amphitheater had been formed by massive trees growing in a circle, their branches weaving together far overhead to create a living dome. And there, in the center of this magical space, something wonderful was about to begin.
