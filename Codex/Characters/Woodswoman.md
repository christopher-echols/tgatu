# Woodswoman

**Character Name:** Wydelysa ven Maren Aldara ("Forest-magic's chosen one, noble of the sea")
**Also:** Stellara El'merys (as the [[Unicorn]])
**Known as:** Maren / The Silver Archer
**Distant relation to:** The Hawthorne family (through Alder Hawthorne II)

**One-sentence storyline:** A coastal princess who fled an arranged marriage discovers true love and harmony with a forest-dwelling commoner, only to face the forest's transformative power when saving him leads her to unknowingly accept an eternal role as guardian of the magical realm she once feared.

**Motivation (abstract want):** To protect and nurture harmony between the human and magical worlds, while secretly longing for genuine human connection and friendship that her dual nature and responsibilities have denied her for centuries.

**Goal (concrete want):** To guide Ionia on her journey to save her father, recognizing in their story an echo of her own centuries-old tale, while helping the girl understand that love sometimes means accepting transformation rather than fighting it.

**Conflict (preventing her from reaching the goal):**

- **Internal:** The loneliness of immortality and her yearning for human connection balanced against her duty to remain secretive and distant
- **External:** The challenge of showing others the path while knowing they must walk it themselves
- **Philosophical:** Understanding that being a bridge between worlds means being fully part of neither, yet somehow part of both

**Epiphany (what she learns):** That despite her centuries of solitude, genuine connection is still possible, and that in Ionia she may have found not just an echo of her past but a possibility for friendship in her future.

**One-paragraph storyline:** Born to a warlike maritime kingdom, Princess Maren fled an arranged marriage meant to save her failing nation, finding refuge and love with Alder Hawthorne II, who taught her to live in harmony with the woodland's ways. When bounty hunters drove them to the edge of the Eldwood, Alder sacrificed himself to protect her, entering the forbidden realm uninvited and losing himself to its magic. Transformed by the Woodland Elder to enter the Eldwood, Maren became the unicorn Stellara El'merys, but discovered that saving Alder meant patiently teaching him everything he had once taught her about the forest. In accepting the forest's invitation, she unknowingly became eternally youthful while her restored love aged and eventually died a mortal death. Now, centuries later, she lives in the home they built together, wearing his ring on a chain and serving as guardian of the boundary between mundane and magical realms. When she encounters Ionia at the boundary stream—transforming from unicorn to human form in a desperate attempt to prevent the child from sharing her father's fate—she reveals her dual nature earlier than intended. Unable to save both father and daughter from the Eldwood's transformation magic, she chooses to protect Ionia while promising to help find a way to rescue Rowan before his memories fade completely.

## Voice & Communication Style

**Speech Patterns:**

- Speaks with a subtle accent that hints at her distant coastal origins
- Uses precise, carefully chosen words that reflect centuries of language evolution
- Occasionally employs turns of phrase or expressions that sound slightly archaic
- Transitions between practical, direct statements and more poetic observations
- Voice carries musical quality, especially when discussing the forest or its magic
- Sometimes pauses mid-sentence as if translating thoughts from another language
- Tends to use "one" rather than "you" when discussing general principles

**When Meeting Ionia:** "Stay where you are, child. The path you follow leads nowhere you wish to go." _[slight head tilt, assessing]_ "What brings you so deep into these woods? Few venture this far without purpose... or desperation."

**When Explaining the Forest:** "The forest remembers what most humans forget. It holds memories in its roots and wisdom in its branches. The Eldwood isn't cruel, merely... absolute in its nature. Those who enter uninvited begin to change. First memories fade like morning mist, then identity unravels like an old tapestry. Some call it a curse. I see it differently—a transformation rather than a punishment."

**When Speaking of Her Past:** "I once lived by the sea, where the waves sang different songs than these forest winds. My family sought power through alliance, but I..." _[fingers touching the ring at her throat]_ "...I found something far more precious here among the trees. Love changes us in ways no magic could match. Sometimes, the greatest transformation comes from choice rather than enchantment."

**When Offering Guidance:** "I cannot walk your path for you, Ionia. Each step must be your own. But I can tell you this—the forest responds to intention as much as action. Fear clouds your sight; love may clarify it. Your father followed you out of love, not carelessness. Remember that when you face what lies ahead."

**When Revealing Hard Truths:** "Time works differently in the Eldwood. What feels like moments here might be hours for your father. Each memory that slips away makes room for the forest to enter. If you hesitate too long, the father you seek may not be the one you find. He will still exist, but as something new—part of the forest rather than separate from it."

**Distinctive Phrases:**

- "The forest has many voices if one knows how to listen."
- "Time is a strange river in these woods."
- "Some choices, once made, cannot be unmade—only transformed."
- "The oldest trees remember what even the stones have forgotten."
- "Fear sees shadows; wisdom recognizes patterns."

**Non-verbal Communication:**

- Often communicates as much through silence as through words
- Uses subtle hand gestures that emphasize key points
- Eyes reveal deeper knowledge behind carefully chosen words
- Posture shifts subtly when transitioning between casual conversation and important revelations
- Demonstrates remarkable ability to read Ionia's unspoken thoughts and feelings
- Creates comfortable silences that encourage reflection rather than discomfort
- Uses physical stillness to command attention for important statements
