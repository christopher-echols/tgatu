# Pilferers

![[Pilferers.png]]

Pilferers are magical forest creatures that inhabit the boundary between the ordinary woodland and the deeper enchantments of the Eldwood. About the size of raccoons but with sleeker fur and more sophisticated behavior, they operate in coordinated groups to "borrow" items that catch their interest. Their remarkable intelligence, color-shifting fur, and ability to create convincing performances make them appear at first glance to be merely clever animals - until they reveal their true magical nature. While their intentions are more mischievous than malicious, pilferers often serve as unwitting guides, leading humans toward significant encounters with the forest's deeper magic. Their theft of Ionia's lunch basket serves as the catalyst that draws her into the magical forest and toward her destiny.
