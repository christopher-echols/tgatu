# Ionia Hawthorne

_The women in the village smile knowingly and tell Linny that her daughter is an old soul, wise beyond her years. Clever and observant, Ionia isn't like the other village children. She seems to see and sense things others don't. Not brooding or gloomy, she's bright and kind to people and animals alike. Yet Ionia is often shy, reluctant to try things for the first time. She has a little voice inside that constantly warns her of how everything could go wrong. To quiet this voice, she fastidiously studies the world around her, observing, learning, documenting everything she sees as drawings in her leather-bound journal. She occupies her busy mind by making little crafts, much like her mother does. She carries a small, worn stuffed animal, Goodfriend Foxy, with her to reassure her when she's lost and protect her from suspicious shadows at the forest's edge. Fascinated by the plants and animals she encounters every day, Ionia longs to learn more about the deep forest and the magical creatures said to dwell there. She struggles to overcome her fear of the unknown in order to explore the wonders of the world beyond her doorstep._

    - **When afraid**: "Oh, I DO want to see the shooting stars, Father. But I can't... not at night! There are Shadowhounds about after dark waiting to snatch us up. No. No. No."
    - **During normal conversation**: "Father, can we go to the farrier's so I can draw the horses? I don't want to go by myself."
    - **Would never say**: "I don't care how anyone feels about this" or "It doesn't matter if this upsets me" or "Let's just do something without thinking about how it might feel."
