# Ionia Hawthorne

**Character Name:** Ionia Hawthorne
**Age:** 10 years old
**Race:** Human
**Gender:** Female

**Vignette:**
_The women in the village smile knowingly and tell Linny that her daughter is an old soul, wise beyond her years. Clever and observant, Ionia isn't like the other village children. She seems to see and sense things others don't. Not brooding or gloomy, she's bright and kind to people and animals alike. Yet Ionia is often shy, reluctant to try things for the first time. She has a little voice inside that constantly warns her of how everything could go wrong. To quiet this voice, she fastidiously studies the world around her, observing, learning, documenting everything she sees as drawings in her leather-bound journal. She occupies her busy mind by making little crafts, much like her mother does. She carries a small, worn stuffed animal, Goodfriend Foxy, with her to reassure her when she's lost and protect her from suspicious shadows at the forest's edge. Fascinated by the plants and animals she encounters every day, Ionia longs to learn more about the deep forest and the magical creatures said to dwell there. She struggles to overcome her fear of the unknown in order to explore the wonders of the world beyond her doorstep._

## Summary

**One-sentence storyline:**
- A cautious young girl who prefers the safety of home must venture into the magical depths of a forbidden forest to save her father, discovering her own inner strength through the journey.

**Motivation (abstract want):**
- To feel safe and secure while still experiencing the wonder and magic she secretly yearns for.

**Goal (concrete want):**
- To find and rescue her father from the Eldwood before he loses his memories and identity to the forest's magic.

**Conflict (preventing her from reaching the goal):**
- **Internal:** Her fear of the unknown and tendency to doubt herself
- **External:** The forest's increasingly dangerous magical elements
- **Philosophical:** The tension between maintaining safety and embracing adventure/growth

**Epiphany (what she learns):**
- That true courage isn't about not being afraid, but about loving something more than you fear it; and that sometimes keeping what you love means being brave enough to let it change.

**One-paragraph storyline:**
- Ionia begins as a girl caught between two worlds - drawn to the magic and mystery of the forest, yet held back by her fears and her mother's warnings. While she admires her father's comfortable relationship with the woodland, she prefers to experience adventure through drawings and dreams rather than reality. When her choice to chase the pilferers leads to her father's disappearance into the Eldwood, she must confront her guilt and fear, learning to trust both the magical beings she encounters and, more importantly, herself. Through her journey, she discovers that her cautious nature isn't a weakness but a strength - teaching her to observe, think, and make careful choices rather than rash decisions. With each challenge she faces - from following the unicorn to trusting the mysterious woodswoman to finally entering the Eldwood to save her father - she builds not just courage but wisdom, ultimately understanding that love requires both the bravery to hold on and the strength to embrace change.

## Voice Samples

**In Ordinary Moments:**
- "Father, can we go to the farrier's so I can draw the horses? I don't want to go by myself."

**When Excited:**
- "Hoofbert! I just found a lily-of-the-valley in the glade behind Father's sawmill! You know I've been hoping to find one since I was at least four and now I have and I wanted SO badly to pluck it and bring it to Mother, but I would never do that. So I'm going to run inside and ask if she'll leave her carving and come with me to examinate it up close. OH, HOOFBERT!"

**When Afraid:**
- "Oh, I DO want to see the shooting stars, Father. But I can't... not at night! There are Shadowhounds about after dark waiting to snatch us up. No. No. No."

**Internal Thoughts:**
- "These shadows aren't behaving properly. They're stretching toward me instead of away from the sun. That is NOT how shadows work. Where is Foxy when I need him?"

**Problem-Solving Mode:**
- "Alright, just think clearly. The pilferers went that way, and the sun is setting behind the big oak, which means East should be... no, that's not right. The sun sets in the West, so East would be... Grr. I will just draw it in the dirt to see it properly."
