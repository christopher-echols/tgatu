# Mother

**Character Name:** Mother (Linnea Hawthorne)

**One-sentence storyline:**
A village artisan's daughter who chose love over prejudice must constantly balance her inherited fears of the forest's magic with her hard-won understanding of its true nature, especially when it comes to protecting her daughter.

**Motivation (abstract want):**
To reconcile her deep-rooted fears about the forest with her love for a family whose life is intertwined with its magic, while ensuring her daughter grows up both safe and strong.

**Goal (concrete want):**
To raise Ionia to be cautious but not fearful, independent but not reckless, teaching her to navigate both the human world of the village and the mysterious realm her father inhabits.

**Conflict (preventing her from reaching the goal):**
- **Internal:** The tension between understanding that the forest's dangers are real and trusting her husband's deeper connection to its ways
- **External:** Living at the edge of a realm that has demonstrably taken people's memories and lives, while being married to a man whose family has some mysterious protection from these dangers
- **Philosophical:** Knowing that both blind fear and blind trust of the forest's power are dangerous, yet having to find a way to prepare her daughter for its reality

**Epiphany (what she learns):**
That true strength comes not from avoiding what we fear, but from facing it with wisdom and courage - a lesson she learns through both her daughter's journey and her own continuing growth.

**One-paragraph storyline:**
Linnea (Linny) comes from a long line of village artisans whose history with the forest is as complex as the wood they work. Her people built their homes from trees felled at what was once the forest's edge, but as woodsmen pushed northward, they encountered the ancient magic of the Eldwood - a power that could strip men of their memories or make them vanish entirely. While the village retreated in fear, certain families like Aldwin's maintained a mysterious accord with the woodland, able to enter and leave freely where others dared not go. When Linnea (Linny) falls in love with Aldwin, she must reconcile her community's well-founded caution - based on generations of real encounters with the forest's power - with her growing understanding of his family's different relationship with the woods. Her craftsmanship becomes a bridge between these worlds, transforming the forest's raw materials into objects of beauty and use, while never forgetting the power inherent in the wood itself. Yet when Ionia is born, Linnea (Linny) faces her greatest challenge: how to protect her daughter from very real dangers without trapping her in fear, how to honor both her husband's wisdom and her own community's hard-earned wariness of the forest's magic. When Ionia ventures into the forest with Aldwin, Linnea (Linny) must trust not just in her husband's protection, but in her daughter's ability to find her own way between the human and magical worlds - even as her heart remembers every story of those who never returned from the woods.
