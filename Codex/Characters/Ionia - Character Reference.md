# Ionia Hawthorne

_The women in the village smile knowingly and tell Linny that her daughter is an old soul, wise beyond her years. Clever and observant, Ionia isn't like the other village children. She seems to see and sense things others don't. Not brooding or gloomy, she's bright and kind to people and animals alike. Yet Ionia is often shy, reluctant to try things for the first time. She has a little voice inside that constantly warns her of how everything could go wrong. To quiet this voice, she fastidiously studies the world around her, observing, learning, documenting everything she sees as drawings in her leather-bound journal. She occupies her busy mind by making little crafts, much like her mother does. She carries a small, worn stuffed animal, Goodfriend Foxy, with her to reassure her when she's lost and protect her from suspicious shadows at the forest's edge. Fascinated by the plants and animals she encounters every day, Ionia longs to learn more about the deep forest and the magical creatures said to dwell there. She struggles to overcome her fear of the unknown in order to explore the wonders of the world beyond her doorstep._

## Character Essence

**Age**: 10 years old  
**Core Truth**: Ionia's deep love for her family drives her actions, even when that love requires her to face her greatest fears.

## Observable Traits

### Physical Appearance

- Slight build but surprisingly strong for her size
- Unruly brown hair she tries unsuccessfully to keep tamed in a practical plait

- Dresses practically in clothing that allows for movement and has many pockets for collecting specimens
- A small, sheathed, handmade knife (cold iron) is attached to her belt
- Wears wool leggings and soft leather boots that come up nearly to her knees
- Carries a small waxed canvas bag across her back that holds a drawing book filled with handmade paper pages, some charcoal crayons, a roll of clean cotton strips for bandages, and a small tin of beeswax for cuts and scrapes
- A strong climber and loves to swim

### Behaviors & Mannerisms

- Tilts her head slightly when listening intently, like a bird
- Squints one eye and scrunches her nose when concentrating
- Fidgets with her pencil or hair, twirling it between her fingers
- Tends to crouch rather than sit when observing something interesting
- Can be overwhelmed by too much noise or when startled by a loud sound
- Makes small humming sounds when thinking deeply
- Counts steps under her breath when entering unfamiliar territory
- Tests the sturdiness of branches before trusting her weight to them
- Stands back to observe before participating in new activities
- Constantly documents observations in her sketchbook

### Voice & Communication

- Uses precise, sometimes unnecessary vocabulary when describing things that interest her
- Creates unique compounds words when existing ones don't capture what she means
- Asks multi-layered questions that often start with "But what if..."
- Sometimes speaks too loudly out of enthusiasm or excitement
- Often narrates her mishaps with dramatic flair while they're happening
- Communicates volumes through micro-expressions
- Will sometimes draw a picture to explain something when she is too uncomfortable or anxious to talk about a subject

**Sample Dialogue:**

- **When excited**: "Hoofbert! I just found a lily-of-the-valley in the glade behind Father's sawmill! You know I've been hoping to find one since I was at least four and now I have and I wanted SO badly to pluck it and bring it to Mother, but I would never do that."
- **When afraid**: "Oh, I DO want to see the shooting stars, Father. But I can't... not at night! There are Shadowhounds about after dark waiting to snatch us up. No. No. No."
- **During normal conversation**: "Father, can we go to the farrier's so I can draw the horses? I don't want to go by myself."
- **Internal thoughts**: "These shadows aren't behaving properly. They're stretching toward me instead of away from the sun. That is NOT how shadows work. Where is Foxy when I need him?"
- **Problem-solving mode**: "Alright, just think clearly. The pilferers went that way, and the sun is setting behind the big oak, which means East should be... no, that's not right. The sun sets in the West, so East would be... Grr. I will just draw it in the dirt to see it properly."
- **Would never say**: "I don't care how anyone feels about this" or "It doesn't matter if this upsets me" or "Let's just do something without thinking about how it might feel."

## Relationships & Interactions

### With Family

- **With Father:** Feels safe when he is around; admires his easy confidence in the forest; wants to be brave like him but doesn't believe she can be; observes his woodcraft carefully, mentally cataloging his techniques; feels safest when within earshot of his axe rhythm; worries her anxiety and mistakes disappoint him
- **With Mother:** Wants her mother to be more adventurous, so they could go out together; embraces her mother's practical caution while secretly yearning for adventure; absorbs her stories about forest dangers with mixed fear and fascination; shares her artistic sensibility and attention to detail; feels torn between her mother's warnings and her father's woodland comfort; often imagines her mother's reaction to new discoveries
- **With Hoofbert:** Considers the old mule a confidant who keeps her secrets; practices being brave by telling Hoofbert her fears; feels responsible for his wellbeing and comfort; finds the rhythm of his walking deeply reassuring; sees him as a bridge between the safety of home and the adventure of the forest

### With Magical Beings

- **With Forest Creatures:** Approaches with respectful caution rather than fear; believes they have their own important business she's privileged to observe; tries to "think like them" to understand their movements and choices; speaks to them in a special whispered voice she uses for nothing else
- **With Stellara (Unicorn):** Has drawn the unicorn repeatedly in her sketchbook, relying on her dreams and village tales to reveal the details before ever encountering the real thing; initially sees the unicorn as a magical guardian appearing at her moment of greatest need; feels a wordless connection despite their inability to communicate verbally; trusts the unicorn's guidance intuitively, following without fully understanding why; experiences wonder and awe that temporarily overrides her usual caution; unaware that the unicorn has observed her for years from hidden vantage points
- **With Maren (Woodswoman):** Initially startled and wary of this mysterious woman who appears at the boundary; gradually develops trust as Maren demonstrates knowledge of the forest and genuine concern; sees Maren as a potential mentor who understands both human and forest worlds; feels both intimidated by and drawn to Maren's confidence in the forest; curious about the gold ring Maren wears on a chain and the sadness it seems to evoke; unaware of Maren's centuries-long connection to her family and observation of her childhood
- **With Wyrnox (Shadow Warden):** Experiences Wyrnox initially through the shadow creatures rather than directly; fears the darkness and coldness associated with Wyrnox's presence; gradually comes to understand Wyrnox represents necessary boundaries rather than malice; begins to recognize patterns in how the shadow creatures behave - herding rather than hunting; challenged to overcome her fear of darkness to see the purpose behind Wyrnox's actions; eventually must confront Wyrnox directly to save her father from transformation
- **With Eldwys (Woodland Elder):** Initially experiences Eldwys as a comforting presence amid the forest's more frightening elements; drawn to the harmonizing voices that speak through the ancient trees; finds her thoughts becoming clearer in Eldwys's grove, as if the confusion of the forest lifts; intuitively understands Eldwys's nurturing aspect connects to her own creative observation; sees Eldwys as a potential ally in saving her father from Wyrnox's transformation; unaware that Eldwys sees in her the potential to heal the ancient breach between her family and the forest
- **With the Valduar'sha (Shadow Creatures):** Initially perceives them as the terrifying monsters from village children's stories; experiences their herding behavior firsthand when they drive her deeper into the Eldwood; gradually distinguishes between their frightening appearance and their actual purpose; learns specific techniques from Maren to navigate past them rather than fighting; discovers they respond to intention as much as action; eventually understands they are extensions of Wyrnox's will rather than independent predators
