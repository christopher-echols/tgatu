**Character Name:** Father (Rowan Hawthorne)

**One-sentence storyline:**
A wise woodcutter who respects the forest's ancient magic must face its transformative power when fear and love for his daughter lead him to break his own rules and cross into forbidden territory.

**Motivation (abstract want):**
To maintain harmony between the human and magical worlds while protecting his family.

**Goal (concrete want):**
To find and rescue his daughter when he believes she's lost in the dangerous depths of the forest.

**Conflict (preventing him from reaching the goal):**
- **Internal:** The tension between his role as protector of both his daughter and the forest's boundaries
- **External:** The Eldwood's memory-erasing magic that begins to make him forget who he is
- **Philosophical:** His deep understanding of the forest's rules versus his instinct to save his child at any cost

**Epiphany (what he learns):**
That true harmony with the forest comes not from rigid boundaries but from understanding that love and magic can transform without destroying what makes us who we are.

**One-paragraph storyline:**
Father (Rowan) begins as a man who has found his place in the world - a woodcutter who understands and respects the delicate balance between human needs and forest magic. His careful treatment of the woods and deep knowledge of its ways suggest an unspoken pact with forces he never discusses directly. When Ionia disappears, his role as guardian of the forest's boundaries conflicts directly with his love for his daughter, forcing him to make an impossible choice. By entering the Eldwood out of fear for her safety, he breaks his own sacred rules, and the forest's magic begins to erase his memories as consequence. Through his daughter's quest to save him, he learns that his rigid adherence to boundaries, while born of wisdom, must sometimes yield to love's transformative power. In the end, he discovers that carrying the forest's magic within his heart strengthens rather than diminishes his identity as both woodcutter and father.
