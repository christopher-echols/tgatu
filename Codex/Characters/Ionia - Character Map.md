# Ionia Hawthorne

**Age**: 10 years old  
**Race:** Human  
**Gender**: Female

## Guiding Star

_The core truth that directs the character, even when they're lost_

- Ionia's deep love for her family drives her actions, even when that love requires her to face her greatest fears.

## Compass Rose

### NORTH: Above the Horizon

_What the character shows to the world_

- **Appearance**: Slight build with unruly brown hair often in a practical plait; expressive blue-gray eyes that brighten to sapphire when excited; often has charcoal smudges on her fingertips and face; dressed practically in clothes with many pockets.
- **Observable Behaviors**: Constantly sketching and documenting the world around her; tilts her head like a bird when listening; squints one eye when concentrating; counts steps when entering unfamiliar territory.
- **Known Talents**: Natural aptitude for drawing that she pursues for love rather than utility; good memory for details; recognizes bird songs and animal tracks; surprising knowledge of medicinal plants.
- **Unique Voice**: "I just need to draw it so I can understand it properly."
- **External Conflict**: Her cautious nature clashes with the adventure and danger the forest presents; her desire to please both parents whose approaches to the forest drastically differ.

### SOUTH: Below the Horizon

_What the character hides (here be monsters)_

- **Secret Fear**: Deep-rooted fear of change in all its forms; anxiety that her world might suddenly shift beyond her understanding; fear that her caution makes her weak and disappointing to her father.
- **Hidden Depths**: Latent transformative magic tied directly to her self-confidence; abilities that manifest unconsciously at first (flowers blooming, animals calming) but have potential to develop into conscious transformation powers.
- **Unconscious Patterns**: Creating elaborate escape plans for unlikely scenarios; narrating her thoughts constantly to herself; approaching magical beings with respect rather than fear; unconsciously resisting any change to her routines or environment.
- **Unmet Needs**: To be valued for her caution rather than despite it; to experience wonder without sacrificing safety; to understand that change can be embraced without losing herself.
- **Internal Conflict**: Needing to embrace change (transformation) to access her magic while fundamentally fearing change; wanting to grow while clinging to the familiar.

### WEST: Where They've Been

_The experiences that shaped them into the character we can see_

- **Formative Moments**: Growing up between her mother's practical warnings and her father's woodland comfort; the stories of forest dangers that became the foundation of her fears.
- **Source of Joy**: Documenting the natural world in her sketchbook; the rhythm of her father's axe that signals safety; moments of discovery when finding new plants or creatures.
- **Defining Wounds**: The indirect trauma of village stories about those who never returned from the forest; the shame of feeling fearful when she believes she shouldn't be.
- **Identity Struggle**: Reconciling her mother's cautious approach with her father's comfortable relationship with the woodland.
- **Legacy**: The complex Hawthorne family history with the forest that she feels but doesn't fully understand.

### EAST: Where They're Going

_The journey that will lead them somewhere we can't yet see_

- **Becoming**: A bridge between the human world and the forest's magic; a conscious wielder of transformation magic who can change herself and help others transform.
- **Essential Lesson**: That change is not something to fear but to embrace; that transformation doesn't mean losing oneself but discovering new aspects of identity.
- **Emerging Strength**: Her growing magical abilities that develop in direct relationship to her self-confidence; transformation magic that begins unconsciously but evolves into deliberate control.
- **Want vs. Need**: Wants to rescue her father and return to the safety of the unchanging; needs to embrace change itself to access her full magical potential and truly grow.
- **Transformation**: From a girl who fears any change to one who can literally transform herself and her world; from resisting the unknown to consciously shaping it through her own magic.

## BOUNDARIES

_How they interact with those around them_

- **With Friends**: Few friends her own age; forms connections through sharing observations and drawings; shows surprising empathy despite her social reservation.
- **With Enemies**: Initially freezes or retreats; gradually learns to analyze threats and find creative solutions; uses observation rather than confrontation.
- **With Authority/Power**: Respectful and attentive; absorbs teachings even when scared; questions rules only when they conflict with protecting loved ones.
- **With New Situations**: Approaches cautiously, observing before participating; creates mental maps and escape routes; uses drawing to process and understand.
- **With Newfound Power**: Initially distrusts it; gradually incorporates it into her identity as she discovers her latent connection to forest magic; uses it to protect rather than for herself.
