## Origins of the Covenant (circa 1380-1420)

Long before the War of Three Crowns, when the Great Northwood Forest stretched far beyond its current boundaries, the first Hawthornes settled at the forest's edge. Unlike other human settlers who feared the deep woods, Alder Hawthorne (1355-1438) and his kin possessed an unusual affinity for the forest ways. Where others heard only wind through leaves, the Hawthornes discerned whispers; where others saw random growth, they recognized patterns and purpose.

Wyrnox, ancient spirit of the forest, observed these humans with curious interest. They harvested from the woods, yet they also tended it—planting seeds, clearing deadfall, speaking words of thanks when taking timber. After many seasons of watching, Wyrnox approached Alder Hawthorne during a solstice night as he meditated beside a small fire.

Their covenant was simple but profound: The Hawthornes would serve as guardians of the boundary between the common woods and the sacred Eldwood. They would teach sustainable harvest to other woodsmen, ensure proper rituals of gratitude were observed, and protect the guardian trees that marked the ancient boundary. In exchange, the Hawthornes would receive the forest's blessing—prosperity, long life, and wisdom that few humans could comprehend.

Small shrines were established at key points along the boundary, where offerings of honey, grain, and carved tokens were left at each full moon. The Hawthornes prospered, building a modest homestead that harmonized with the surrounding forest. Their timber was sought after for its unusual properties—stronger, more resistant to rot, and somehow more beautiful than wood harvested by others.

## Rise to Prominence (circa 1500-1650)

As human settlements expanded, the Hawthornes' importance grew. Under the stewardship of Sorrel Hawthorne (1490-1562), the family's influence extended beyond mere forestry. Sorrel established formal agreements with the emerging kingdoms that bordered the Great Northwood, ensuring sustainable harvesting practices were encoded in royal charters.

The Hawthornes became diplomats of a sort—intermediaries between the human realm and the forest. They established the first formal Guild of Woodsmen, training apprentices in their methods and rituals. Their homestead expanded to include workshops, storehouses, and quarters for apprentices. Yet Sorrel never forgot the family's primary duty—each new moon, he would walk the boundary alone, communing with Wyrnox and renewing their ancient pledge.

During this period, the Hawthornes accumulated considerable wealth, though they lived modestly compared to the merchant families in larger settlements. Their true wealth lay in respect—from woodsmen who sought their guidance, from nobility who prized their timber, and from the forest itself, which seemed to bend toward them as they walked its paths.

## The Golden Age (circa 1650-1720)

Under Sorrel's son, Hazel Hawthorne (1525-1610), the family reached new heights of prosperity and respect. The three neighboring kingdoms—Eastmark, Southshore, and the Western Reach—all sought exclusive arrangements with the Hawthornes. Rather than favor any single power, Hazel established a remarkable system wherein each kingdom received specific types of timber for their particular needs: Eastmark for shipbuilding, Southshore for construction, and the Western Reach for fine furniture and instruments.

The Hawthorne estate grew into a complex of buildings, including a great hall built entirely from fallen trees—not a single living tree was cut for its construction. The family's prosperity benefited the entire region as they employed many villagers in their operations.

Hazel maintained the boundary traditions with exceptional diligence, even establishing a school where the children of woodsmen could learn the old ways of forest harmony. He had seven children, all of whom he raised to understand the sacred trust placed in their family.

## Seeds of Decline (circa 1650-1710)

Hazel's youngest son, Willow Hawthorne (1580-1660), inherited the family responsibility. Unlike his father and grandfather, Willow had a fascination with the wider world beyond the forest. He traveled extensively, bringing back exotic goods and ideas. Though he maintained the boundary rituals, his heart was increasingly drawn to the growing cities and the wealth they represented.

Under Willow's guidance, the Hawthorne operations became more commercial. He established trading outposts in distant cities and expanded their harvesting operations significantly. For the first time, the family began employing large crews of men from outside the local villages—men who had not been raised with respect for the forest traditions.

Willow's grandson, Aspen Hawthorne (1630-1695), inherited this expanded enterprise and continued its commercialization, focusing even more on profit than tradition. Though neither Willow nor Aspen directly violated the covenant with Wyrnox, each generation's connection to the forest's deeper purpose grew more tenuous. If the offerings at the shrines became more perfunctory and less heartfelt, Wyrnox gave no sign of displeasure.

## Betrayal: The War of Three Crowns (1712-1715)

Aspen's son, Rowan Hawthorne I (1660-1720), inherited a vast enterprise that had drifted far from its original purpose. The family name was now associated more with fine timber than with forest stewardship. Rowan's son Cedar (1685-1730) continued this trend, and Cedar's son Edmund Hawthorne (1705-1760) had little interest in the old rituals, viewing them as quaint traditions to be maintained for appearance's sake. Edmund's true passion lay in expanding the family's wealth and influence.

When tensions erupted into the War of Three Crowns in 1712 – a conflict between Eastmark, Southshore, and the Western Reach over disputed territories along the forest's eastern edge – Edmund saw unprecedented opportunity. Demand for timber skyrocketed as each kingdom raced to build warships, fortifications, and siege engines. Edmund expanded operations dramatically, hiring hundreds of additional woodsmen and establishing multiple new cutting camps throughout the forest.

As easily accessible timber grew scarce, Edmund faced a choice—honor the ancient boundary and limit his profits, or expand into the forbidden zones. The decision came gradually. First, he authorized cutting close to the boundary, assuring his foremen that Wyrnox would understand the necessity. Then, as prices climbed higher, he permitted selective harvesting of smaller guardian trees, reasoning that the larger, more powerful trees remained untouched.

In the winter of 1715, the consequences of Edmund's carelessness proved catastrophic. As logging operations expanded rapidly to meet wartime demand, Edmund delegated increasingly important responsibilities to foremen who understood profit but not the sacred covenant. Maps marking protected areas were outdated, boundary markers neglected, and in the chaos of expanded operations, the unthinkable occurred.

Three massive guardian oaks—ancient sentinels that had stood for over a thousand years, whose roots were said to reach into the very heart of the Eldwood—were felled by crews who did not understand their significance. These were not merely trees but living anchors of the boundary, specifically named in the original covenant with Wyrnox, their protection a fundamental element of the trust between forest and family.

## Judgment and Aftermath (1715-1720)

Edmund, realizing the magnitude of his failure, did what none of his ancestors had needed to do: he entered the forest to beg Wyrnox's forgiveness. Taking only a lantern, he journeyed to the ancient boundary stone where offerings had traditionally been left. There, it is said, he waited three days and nights without food or water, calling for Wyrnox to hear his plea.

On the third night, the forest answered—not with forgiveness but with judgment. A strange mist rolled from the Eldwood, engulfing first Edmund, then spreading outward to the logging camps, roads, and eventually the Hawthorne estate itself. Those who fled spoke of moving shadows and whispers that seemed to carry Edmund's voice calling out in terror.

When the mist receded days later, the consequences were devastating. Dozens of woodsmen had vanished without trace. Equipment lay rusted and broken as though exposed to decades of neglect. The massive stumps where the guardian trees had stood wept a dark sap that no one dared touch. And Edmund Hawthorne himself was never seen again—absorbed into the forest he had failed to protect.

True to his nature, Wyrnox did not violate the original covenant—the designated harvesting areas remained accessible to the Hawthornes. But the boundary of the Eldwood was sealed with an unbreakable decree: no human would enter uninvited ever again. The shadow creatures—manifested from Wyrnox's will—became guardians of the boundary, ensuring none crossed who were not welcome.

The Hawthorne family's fall was catastrophic. Their contracts were broken, their reputation ruined. The three kingdoms, believing the family had somehow betrayed them individually, severed all ties. The village, which had lost sons and fathers to the mist, turned against them. Within a few years, their grand estate had been largely abandoned, with only the original homestead remaining occupied.

## Atonement Begins: The Two Paths (1720-1760)

Edmund's disappearance left his twin sons with a shattered legacy and a choice about how to rebuild. The eldest, Reed Hawthorne (1730-1795), chose to remain in the human world. Unlike his father, Reed remembered the stories his grandfather had told him about the family's true purpose. Though the grand estate was lost, Reed maintained the original homestead and returned to the fundamental practice of respectful forestry.

Edmund's younger son, Alder Hawthorne II (1730-1765), named after the family's founder in hope of a brighter future, chose a different path. While Reed worked to restore the family name through humble service to the village, Alder vanished into the forest, supposedly traveling westward to start anew. The family spread word that he had moved away or died of fever, fearing people would believe the forest had claimed yet another Hawthorne as punishment.

In truth, Alder had retreated deep into the forest, building a solitary dwelling far from human settlements but carefully respecting the boundary of the Eldwood. There he lived in harmony with the woodland, following the oldest teachings of his ancestors. He took only what he needed, replanted what he harvested, and renewed the ancient rituals of gratitude that his father had neglected. Though he never crossed the forbidden boundary, he often left offerings at its edge, seeking some form of redemption for his family's betrayal.

It was during this self-imposed exile that Alder encountered a fleeing princess – Maren of the Eastern Shores – who had escaped an arranged marriage meant to forge a political alliance. Lost and frightened in the unfamiliar forest, she stumbled upon his simple cabin. Alder taught the princess everything he knew about living in balance with the woodland realm – how to move silently through the underbrush, how to harvest without harming, how to read the signs of the forest's moods in the movement of birds and the swaying of leaves.

In time, their friendship blossomed into love, and they built a life together at the forest's edge. For several years, they lived in peaceful seclusion, until the princess's would-be husband sent hunters to find her. When these men drove them to the very boundary of the Eldwood, Alder made the ultimate sacrifice – leading the hunters away from Maren by crossing into the forbidden realm. He knew what fate awaited him there but chose love over self-preservation.

When Maren later sought to rescue him, she encountered the Woodland Elder, who offered her a choice: remain human and lose him forever, or accept transformation to enter the Eldwood and find him. Her willing transformation into the unicorn Stellara allowed her to enter without violating Wyrnox's law. Though she found Alder, his memories were already fading. With infinite patience, she helped him remember not who he had been, but who he could be – a creature of the forest at peace with the woodland realm.

Meanwhile, Reed continued his solitary work, unaware of his brother's fate. Reed had a son named Oak (1755-1820), who grew up hearing stories of his uncle Alder's supposed westward journey – never knowing the truth of his sacrifice or transformation.

## The Line Continues: Oak and Rowan (1760-1820)

Oak Hawthorne grew up hearing tales of his family's once-great status and the covenant they had broken. From his earliest days, he was taught the true history of their family—both its honored beginnings and its shameful betrayal. Oak grew into a solemn, thoughtful man who saw his life's purpose as one of gradual redemption.

When Reed died, Oak continued the humble work of selective timber harvesting. He helped rebuild relations with the village by offering his services freely during harsh winters, never asking payment for firewood from those in need. Though the villagers still regarded the Hawthornes with suspicion, they began to separate Oak from the sins of his grandfather.

Oak married a village woman named Willa, whose family had once worked for the Hawthornes in better days. Together they had two sons—the elder died young from fever, leaving only Rowan II (1785-present) to carry on the family name.

## The Last of the Hawthornes: Rowan Ionia (1785-Present)

Rowan Hawthorne II grew up understanding the weight of his heritage. From his father Oak, he learned both the practical skills of sustainable forestry and the deeper spiritual connection that had once made his family special. Although the formal boundary shrines had long since crumbled, Rowan continued the practice of leaving small offerings at the edge of the Eldwood—not out of expectation of response, but out of respect for what once was.

Unlike his recent ancestors who worked alone, Rowan dared to hope for restoration. He studied the old family records, learning everything he could about the original covenant. He married Linnea, a woman from the village skilled in woodcraft, who shared his vision of harmony between human needs and forest preservation.

When their daughter Ionia (born 1815) was born, Rowan saw in her something special—an intuitive connection to the natural world that reminded him of the stories about his earliest ancestors. Though he was careful never to burden her with the family's troubled history, he gently encouraged her interest in the forest, teaching her to read its signs and respect its boundaries.

Rowan continued to work as a solitary woodcutter, using only hand tools and taking only what the forest could easily spare. The abandoned equipment of Edmund's operation remained in the deep woods, slowly being reclaimed by nature—a constant reminder of human folly and the consequences of betrayal.

Though respected for his skills and integrity, Rowan remained apart from village life. The shadow of the past hung over him, and he understood that his lifetime alone might not be enough to heal the ancient wound. Yet he persisted in hope that someday, somehow, the broken trust might be restored.

What he could not know was that his daughter Ionia—the last of the Hawthorne line—would face a moment of crisis and choice that would echo the original covenant. In her courage and compassion, the potential for redemption would finally emerge after generations of patient atonement.
