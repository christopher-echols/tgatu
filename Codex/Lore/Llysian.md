# Llysian (The Old Tongue)

_(from "lys" - sacred/magical, pronounced "LISS-ee-an")_

Llysian is the primal language of the world, believed to be the first tongue spoken by the earliest beings. Many of the oldest creatures, places, and magical elements still retain their "true names" in Llysian. These true names are often unspoken in everyday conversation due to their inherent power, with modern equivalents used instead for casual reference.
