## Rooted in classic fairy tales

This story is inspired by and pays homage to classic fairy tale tropes about journeys into the woods and encounters with supernatural antagonists:

1. **The Transformative Journey Through the Dark Forest** - In stories like "Hansel and Gretel," children venture into a dense, mysterious forest where they encounter a supernatural threat—in this case, a cannibalistic witch. The woods represent a liminal space of danger and potential transformation. The children ultimately overcome the witch through their own wit and cleverness, using her own supernatural trap against her by pushing her into her own oven. This trope symbolizes the transition from childhood innocence to survival and empowerment.

2. **The Magical Creature Test of Character** - Tales like "Little Red Riding Hood" involve a protagonist encountering a supernatural predator (the wolf) in the woods, which tests the character's judgment and moral fortitude. While the traditional resolution often involves a male woodcutter saving the protagonist, modern retellings emphasize the protagonist's own ability to outsmart or defeat the supernatural threat. The woods represent a space of moral challenge where one's true nature is revealed.

3. **The Enchanted Forest Challenge** - In stories like "Snow White," the forest is both a place of refuge and a realm of magical danger. The protagonist must navigate supernatural threats (such as the evil queen's huntsman or magical pursuers) while finding protection and allies. The resolution typically involves the protagonist's inherent goodness triumphing over malevolent magical forces, often with the help of woodland creatures or other magical beings.

4. **The Supernatural Bargain in the Woods** - Fairy tales like "Rumpelstiltskin" feature encounters with magical creatures in wooded settings where a supernatural antagonist offers a seemingly beneficial but ultimately treacherous bargain. The protagonist must ultimately outmaneuver the supernatural being through clever wordplay or by discovering the creature's true name, representing the triumph of human intelligence over magical manipulation.

These tropes consistently use the woods as a symbolic space of transformation, challenge, and potential danger—a liminal realm where supernatural forces test human characters, and where wisdom, courage, and wit ultimately prevail over magical threats.
## Influenced by timeless YA authors

This story is undeniably influenced by the authors of my favorite books and series. I hope to have the kind of impact on my readers that they had on me.

1. **Lloyd Alexander -** Alexander crafted richly detailed fantasy narratives with complex characters and mythological influences, particularly drawing from Welsh mythology. His prose is lyrical yet accessible, blending heroic adventure with deep psychological exploration. His works frequently explore personal growth, heroism that stems from inner character rather than external heroic traits, and the transformation of ordinary individuals into extraordinary heroes. Moral complexity and the importance of individual choice are central to his narratives. Best known for "The Chronicles of Prydain" series, Alexander revolutionized children's fantasy by creating nuanced protagonists who grow and change. His work bridged traditional heroic narratives with more psychologically complex character development, influencing generations of fantasy writers.

2. **Peter S. Beagle -** Beagle is renowned for his poetic, deeply lyrical prose that blends fantasy with profound emotional depth. His writing is characterized by a gentle, contemplative tone that often challenges traditional fantasy tropes. His works explore the boundaries between reality and fantasy, the nature of love, loss, and transformation. He frequently uses magical elements as metaphors for human experience and emotional complexity. "The Last Unicorn" stands as his most influential work, transforming the fantasy genre by presenting a deeply melancholic and introspective approach to magical narratives. Beagle demonstrated that fantasy could be a sophisticated literary form capable of profound emotional and philosophical exploration.

3. **Diana Wynne Jones -** Jones crafted intricate, often humorous fantasy narratives with complex magical systems and witty narrative voices. Her writing is characterized by clever world-building and multilayered storytelling. She frequently explored themes of family dynamics, personal identity, alternate realities, and the sometimes chaotic nature of magic. Her works often subvert traditional fantasy tropes, presenting magic as unpredictable and nuanced. Most notably recognized for "Howl's Moving Castle" and her influence on the fantasy genre, Jones revolutionized young adult fantasy by creating intelligent, complex magical worlds that respected young readers' intelligence. Her work significantly influenced later fantasy authors, including Neil Gaiman and J.K. Rowling.

4. **Susan Cooper -** Cooper's prose is atmospheric and mythologically rich, blending contemporary settings with deep mythological and folkloric traditions. Her writing is elegant and evocative, creating a sense of timeless magic. Her "The Dark is Rising" sequence explores the eternal conflict between light and darkness, drawing heavily on Arthurian legends and Celtic mythology. She emphasizes the power of individual choice in cosmic struggles and the connection between past and present. Cooper transformed children's fantasy by integrating complex mythological narratives with contemporary settings. She demonstrated how mythological archetypes could be reimagined for modern young readers, creating a sophisticated approach to fantasy that respected both historical mythological traditions and contemporary storytelling.

These authors collectively transformed children's and young adult fantasy literature in the latter half of the 20th century. They moved beyond simplistic magical narratives, creating complex worlds that treated young readers as intelligent, emotionally sophisticated individuals. Their works emphasized personal growth, moral complexity, and the transformative power of individual choice, significantly expanding the philosophical and emotional depth of fantasy literature.

Each author brought a unique perspective: Alexander's heroic character development, Beagle's poetic introspection, Jones's clever subversion of magical tropes, and Cooper's mythological depth. They challenged the notion that children's fantasy was a lesser literary form, establishing it as a genre capable of profound philosophical and emotional exploration.
