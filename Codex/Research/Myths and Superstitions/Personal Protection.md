**Why it fits:** Simple, historically authentic protection that doesn't require complex magic systems to explain. It gives Ionia practical tools rather than mystical powers. **Implementation:** Ionia's small knife could be iron and provide unexpected protection from shadow creatures. Maren might have iron nails hammered into her door frame, explaining how she can live so near the boundary safely.

- Wearing clothes inside-out immediately disoriented fairies and helped lost travelers find their way home
- People carried small pouches (gris-gris) containing protective herbs like St. John's Wort, vervain, and rowan berries
- Carrying iron (especially cold iron) repelled malevolent fae and could break their enchantments
- Making the sign of an equal-armed cross or drawing it in the air was pre-Christian protection
