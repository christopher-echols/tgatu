The Green Man is a legendary being who embodies the spirit of the forest, often depicted as a face made of leaves and branches. In medieval English churches, his face appears carved in stone, watching over congregations. There's also the legend of the Green Children of Woolpit - a boy and girl with green skin who emerged from the woods speaking an unknown language.

> **The Green Man symbolizes renewal, rebirth, and the cycle of growth and decay in nature.**

He represents the wild, untamed aspects of nature and humanity's connection to the natural world. Many scholars see him as a symbol of spring's triumph over winter and life over death.

**Why it fits:** This provides a visual marker for the transformation process that's central to your story's tensionâ€”what happens to humans who enter the Eldwood uninvited. **Implementation:** The first sign of someone being affected by the forest's magic could be a subtle green tint to their skin or small leaves appearing in their hair. This makes the transformation visible rather than just mental/memory-based.

This could inspire:

- Ancient carvings of leafy faces on boundary trees that seem to watch travelers
- Green-tinged forest dwellers who were once human but have begun to merge with the forest
- The gradual transformation of those who stay too long in the Eldwood beginning with a slight green tint to their skin
