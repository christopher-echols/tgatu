In Celtic and Anglo-Saxon societies, words—especially names—were believed to possess extraordinary power. The concept of "true names" was particularly significant, operating on several key principles:

## The Language of Creation

The concept of naming was also tied to creation myths—speaking a true name wasn't just identifying something but participating in its creation or manifestation.

> **Words were considered creative forces that could literally bring things into being or shape reality.**

This concept survived in Christian adaptations of these traditions, where God speaks the world into existence, and humanity's ability to name creatures (as Adam does in Genesis) represents a delegated creative authority.

The reverence for true names reflects a worldview where language wasn't arbitrary but intrinsically connected to the fabric of reality itself—where speaking wasn't just communication but a profound act of power.

## The Power of True Names

Celtic and Anglo-Saxon cultures believed that knowing and speaking a being's true name gave you power over it. This concept appears throughout their folklore for several reasons:

- **Essence Connection**: Names were thought to contain or reveal the fundamental essence of a being. The true name wasn't just a label but a distillation of the entity's nature and power.
- **Spiritual Vulnerability**: Speaking something's true name created a mystical connection between speaker and subject, opening a channel of influence.
- **Summoning Power**: Especially for supernatural entities, knowing their true name meant you could summon or compel them.

## Protective Naming Practices

These beliefs led to numerous protective customs:

- **Concealment of Names**: People would often have multiple names—a public one and a true name known only to family or kept entirely secret.
- **Kennings and Nicknames**: The use of circumlocutions and nicknames (particularly in Norse and Anglo-Saxon poetry) allowed reference to entities without invoking their true names.
- **Taboo Names**: Certain beings (particularly dangerous supernatural entities like the fae) were referred to by euphemisms: "The Good People," "The Fair Folk," or "The Gentry" rather than their actual names.


**Why it fits:** The "Llysian" language already establishes the importance of names and words. These traditions add depth to how humans interact with forest entities. **Implementation:** People might never say "Eldwood" directly while in the forest (calling it "the deep place" or "the elder realm"). Ionia might be taught never to thank the forest creatures directly—which could create a moment of tension when she instinctively thanks the unicorn.

- Never speaking your true name in the forest, instead using a "forest name"
- Addressing supernatural beings with respectful titles ("Good Neighbors," "Fair Folk," "Gentle People") rather than direct names
- When discussing dangerous beings, referring to them indirectly ("Himself," "The Other Crowd")
- Speaking backward or in rhyme when lost to find your way again
