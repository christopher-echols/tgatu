In Celtic mythology, these twin aspects of the forest god battled twice yearly at the solstices, each ruling for half the year.

**Why it fits:** The tension between wild magic and human needs could be reflected in seasonal changes, giving your forest a dynamic quality. **Implementation:** The boundary might be stronger in winter (Holly King's time) and more permeable in summer (Oak King's time). This could explain why certain forest activities happen in specific seasons, and why Father chose this particular day for Ionia's first deep forest journey.

This duality could appear as:

- Twin aspects of the forest's guardian spirits
- The tension between the wild Eldwood and the "tame" forest where humans harvest
- Seasonal changes in how the forest responds to human presence
