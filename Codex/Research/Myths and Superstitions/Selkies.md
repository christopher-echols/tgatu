These Scottish seal-people could remove their seal skins to become human on land. If someone stole a selkie's skin, they could force the selkie to remain human and often marry them. Eventually, most selkies find their skins and return to the sea.

**Why it fits:** Maren/Stellara's backstory has strong parallels to selkie talesâ€”a being who transforms between forms and chose transformation for love. **Implementation:** Like selkies need their skin to transform, perhaps Maren has a token (her ring?) that enables her transformation between human and unicorn. This gives the magic a concrete focus rather than just being an abstract ability.

This transformation story could inspire:

- How Maren transforms between human and unicorn
- The idea that magical transformation requires an object or token
- A deeper exploration of what it means to choose to change form for love
