In Irish folklore, fairies traveled along specific invisible roads, and building on these paths brought misfortune. Similarly, mushroom fairy rings were places where fairies danced, and stepping inside risked being transported to the fairy realm.

**Why it fits:** Creates specific rules for navigating the forest that feel authentic to folklore while adding interesting obstacles and safe zones. **Implementation:** There could be certain paths that must never be blocked (explaining why Father is careful about where he fells trees). Fairy rings of mushrooms might be places where the transformation magic is particularly potentâ€”or conversely, safe spaces where it cannot reach.

This could inform:

- Specific paths through the forest that must never be blocked by fallen logs
- Circle clearings where the forest's magic is particularly potent
- Times of day when certain routes through the forest become unsafe
