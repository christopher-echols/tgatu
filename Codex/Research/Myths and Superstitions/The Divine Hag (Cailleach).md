This powerful Celtic figure was the goddess of winter who created mountains and shaped landscapes. In spring, she would turn to stone, only to revive in winter.

**Why it fits:** This connects to the idea of natural cycles and transformation as part of nature rather than something unnatural or purely punitive. **Implementation:** The Woodland Elder might have seasonal aspects, appearing differently depending on when encountered. This could add nuance to the forest's magicâ€”it's not just dangerous, but part of a greater cycle that humans once understood but have forgotten.

This cycle could inspire:

- Seasonal changes in the Eldwood's magic and boundaries
- The forest's ancient guardian appearing differently in different seasons
- A counterbalance to Wyrnox - perhaps a spring/summer forest spirit
