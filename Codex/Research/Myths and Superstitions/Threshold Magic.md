**Why it fits:** The story centers on a magical boundary (between normal forest and Eldwood) that has significant consequences when crossed. Traditional threshold magic provides authentic cultural touchpoints. **Implementation:** Father could perform small rituals when approaching the boundaryâ€”perhaps touching specific trees in sequence or leaving a small offering. Ionia, when lost and trying to find her way back, might remember to turn her jacket inside-out as protection, following her mother's teachings.

In Celtic and Norse traditions, thresholds were considered powerful boundary spaces:

- Iron nails driven into doorframes protected against supernatural entities
- Rowan (mountain ash) branches hung over doors kept evil spirits from entering
- Threshold rituals included carrying brides over doorways (originally to prevent evil spirits attaching to them)
- Salt scattered across doorways and windowsills created barriers evil couldn't cross
