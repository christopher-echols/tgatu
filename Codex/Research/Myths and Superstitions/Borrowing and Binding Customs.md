Throughout Celtic lands, there were customs around borrowing items that protected against fairy theft. Never lend salt or fire, always leave payment when taking water from a fairy well, etc. This could inspire:

- Rituals the woodcutters perform before cutting trees (leaving something in exchange)
- The reason why Mother wraps food so carefully and warns about "pilferers"
- Ways Ionia might protect herself in the forest (small offerings, verbal thank-yous)
