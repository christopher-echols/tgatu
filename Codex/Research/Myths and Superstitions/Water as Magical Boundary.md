Water as a boundary for supernatural forces is one of the most consistent elements across European folklore.

**Why it fits:** The stream where Ionia first meets the unicorn is already a perfect application of this widespread belief. Water boundaries create natural "safe zones" in your dangerous forest. **Implementation:** The shadow creatures could be unable to cross running water, making streams vital navigation tools for Ionia. The memory-erasing magic might work more slowly near water, giving Ionia precious time when she finally finds her father.
### Flowing Water

- Spirits, fairies, and other supernatural entities traditionally cannot cross running water
- In Scottish lore, pursuing kelpies and each uisge (water horses) couldn't cross running streams
- Witches were believed unable to cross running water in their transformed states
- Crossing nine running streams was said to break any fairy enchantment

### Water Boundaries

- Rivers often marked boundaries between the mortal world and Otherworld in Celtic mythology
- Islands surrounded by water (especially freshwater) were naturally protected from most supernatural threats
- Circling something three times with water created a protective barrier
- Wells and springs were liminal spaces - both dangerous (as entry points to the Otherworld) and sacred (as sources of healing)

### Water as Sanctuary

- Being "over water" protected against many types of supernatural pursuit
- In Germanic folklore, living on a island or houseboat provided safety from certain night-haunting spirits
- Drawing a circle of water around oneself created temporary sanctuary

### Water and Truth

- Water often forced truth-telling in folk tradition
- Creatures of glamour (illusion) were revealed in their true form when they crossed water
- Water was used for scrying to see truth and hidden things
- Reflections in water could reveal disguised supernatural beings
