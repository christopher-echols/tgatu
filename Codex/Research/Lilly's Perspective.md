*I asked Lilly some questions about how she would react to elements of Ionia's story. These are her answers, without context of the actual questions.*

- I like things that are weird, ugly, and strange
- I am interested in lots of things, and I want to know everything I can about the things I'm interested in
- If I lived in there, I would play in the forest, climb trees, help my parents work (if it wasn't dangerous), I would try and make animals comfortable with me so we could play, I would go to the stream (with permission) to muck around and swim in it (I love swimming), I'd probably look at a lot of plants, pick flowers for Mama, help collecting wood or firewood, sneakily pick vegetables from the garden and eat them. I'd draw a lot, like animals and the house and the forest. I'd draw my parents working. I'd draw lots of plants and nature-y things.
- If I knew that there were scary things in the woods, I'd probably hesitate. But if my dad went with me, then I would do it. If we went missing, I'd want us to go missing as a family.
- I'd stay very close to my dad in the woods. If I felt scared, I'd tell him and ask, "Can we go home now?"
- I would take out my drawing stuff and start sketching everything around me. Literally everything. I would sketch the whole forest. I would want to draw every single detail.
- I would draw all the new forest plants and animals. I would love that.
- If I was lost in the woods and couldn't get back to my dad, I would feel scared and intimidated about what's out there in the woods. I would scream, "Dada, where are you?" and if you heard me, you would come find me. If I didn't get a response after I tried a few times, I would try and find my way back. If I couldn't find my way back, I would try to follow the creature that led me into the woods. If that didn't work, I would feel totally lost and cry a lot.
- If I saw a unicorn when I was crying, I would jump up and try to get close to it. I'd want to see it's face up close.
- I would try to hold out my hand and let it come near to warm up to me. Then I would see if I could get a little closer to it.
