# Character Map

*This map serves as your character's compass â€“ a concise navigational tool that captures their essential nature from all directions. Unlike the detailed Character Field Guide, the Map distills your character to their fundamental truths, helping you maintain course even when navigating complex narrative waters. Return to this map whenever your character feels lost or inconsistent to reconnect with their core essence and the directions they're moving.*
