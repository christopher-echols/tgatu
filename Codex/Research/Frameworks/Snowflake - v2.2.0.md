## 1. Write a one-sentence summary of your novel.
A young girl gets lost in a magical forest where a unicorn helps her find herself.

## 2. Expand that sentence into a full paragraph.
Near a forest where ancient magic still dwells, a cautious girl named Ionia lives with her mother and woodcutter father, who maintains an unspoken pact with the forest's mysterious forces. When mischievous pilferers steal her lunch basket, Ionia follows them deep into the woods where she becomes lost, only to be guided to safety by a unicorn - though she returns to find her father has vanished while searching for her, having crossed into the forbidden Eldwood where those who enter uninvited slowly forget who they are. Guided by the unicorn to a mysterious archer who knows the forest's ways, Ionia ventures deeper into the magical realm but becomes separated from both companions when shadow creatures lead her astray in the dark heart of the woods. With help from the archer - who reveals herself as a former princess who chose to become one with the forest's magic - Ionia must enter the Eldwood alone to find her father before his memories fade completely, knowing that true magic lies not in power but in having the courage to both hold on and let go. Learning to trust her own heart while accepting change, Ionia helps her father remember who he is, and together they return home carrying the forest's magic within them not as a secret to keep, but as a truth to honor.

## 3. Expand each sentence of your summary paragraph into a full paragraph.

Near the edge of the Great Northwood Forest, a cautious young girl named Ionia lives with her mother, a skilled furniture maker, and her father, a woodcutter who understands the forest's ancient magic. Their small cottage sits beside a stream that flows south from the deep woods where her father works, though he's always careful to stay clear of the mysterious Eldwood. The village children tell stories of magical forest animals and frighten each other, pretending to be shadowy creatures from the Eldwood. Ionia, though clever and curious, prefers to stay close to the safety of home, even as she dreams of the beings said to dwell in the woods' heart. But her father knows the forest, reading its signs and respecting the unseen forces he maintains an uspoken truce with. Though Ionia's fear keeps her close to home, she can't help being drawn to the forest's mysteries, especially tales of a majestic unicorn that village children claim to have glimpsed running through the deepest glades. And so, she decides to journey into the woods with her father one day, determined to experience the forest’s mysteries for herself.

At her father's logging camp, Ionia first spots the pilferers playing between the stumps - furry creatures about the size of raccoons with bright, clever eyes. She watches, fascinated, as they scamper and tumble, until she realizes they're working together to steal her lunch basket. Her frightened calls to her father are lost in the steady rhythm of his axe, and after a moment's panic, Ionia convinces herself that following the creatures isn't too dangerous - after all, that basket contains the last of their precious summer bacon. The chase leads her deeper into unfamiliar woods, where the trees grow closer together and strange bird calls echo in the shadows. When the pilferers finally abandon the basket with nothing but an apple left inside, Ionia's triumph turns to dread as she realizes she no longer recognizes anything around her. The trees here seem to watch her with hollow knots like eyes, their branches creaking overhead though there is no wind. Just as terror begins to overwhelm her, she spots something impossible - a creature like a horse but impossibly graceful, its spiral horn gleaming like starlight. Mesmerized, Ionia follows the unicorn through the darkening woods, not realizing it's actually leading her away from the boundary of the Eldwood, where ancient and dangerous magic awaits the unwary.

The unicorn guides Ionia back to the logging camp, but her relief turns to ice in her stomach when she finds it deserted - no rhythmic sound of her father's axe, no cart loaded with fresh-cut logs. "Father?" she calls, her voice swallowed by the watchful trees. She runs to Hoofbert, still tethered where they'd left him. "Where did he go?" she asks the old mule, who only twitches his ears in response. Ionia searches the camp with growing desperation, checking behind every stump and tree, but finds only her father's abandoned axe. She knows she should wait here - that's what her father always taught her to do if she got lost. Or she could ride Hoofbert home to get help. But as she stares down the path she took chasing the pilferers, she knows with terrible certainty where her father must have gone.

Following the jumble of tracks in the soft earth - tiny pilferer prints, her own footsteps, her father's heavy boots - Ionia pushes deeper into the woods. But something strange happens to the trail; the prints begin to fade and blur, as if the forest itself is slowly erasing them. Soon she finds herself lost once again, the panic rising in her chest. Through her tears, she glimpses a familiar silvery shape - the unicorn! But as she runs toward it, a voice rings out clear as a bell: "Go no further." A figure drops lightly from a nearby tree, moving with impossible grace. It's a woman dressed in forest colors, with a long blonde plait and a bow across her back. Despite her woodsman's clothes, there's something otherworldly about her beauty, though she seems perfectly at home among the ancient trees. The archer's eyes grow dark with concern when Ionia describes being separated from her father. "He crossed into the Eldwood searching for you," she tells her. "I've seen what happens to those who enter uninvited - they forget the human world, losing their memories like leaves falling in autumn." Her fingers absently touch a simple gold ring that hangs from a chain around her neck. Though the archer's voice remains steady, her hand doesn't leave the ring at her throat. Ionia feels the weight of her own guilt crash over her - her father entered that forbidden place looking for her - but beneath the guilt, something stronger begins to grow: determination. She won't let her father fade away into the forest's magic like those other lost souls.

## 4. Write a one-page description of each major character and a half-page description of the other important characters.

- [[Ionia]]
- [[Mother]]
- [[Father]]
- [[Unicorn]]
- [[Woodswoman]]

## 5. Expand your character descriptions into full-fledged character charts.

- Detail everything there is to know about each character.
- Most importantly, how will this character change by the end of the novel?
- This is an expansion of step four, and it will teach you a lot about your characters.
- Go back and revise steps one-six as your characters become “real” to you and begin making petulant demands on the story.

## 6. Expand the one-page plot synopsis into a four-page synopsis.
Expand each paragraph from step three into a full page.

- Figure out the high-level logic of the story.
- Make strategic decisions and fix plot issues.
- Circle back and update details in the earlier steps as you gain insight into the story and new ideas emerge.

## 7. Turn the four-page synopsis into a list of all scenes in the story.
Make a spreadsheet detailing the scenes that emerge from your four-page plot outline.

- Make one row for each scene.
- In one column, list the main/POV character.
- In another column, briefly describe what happens in that scene.
- Identify the essential conflict in the scene.
- Drag and drop to rearrange the order of scenes as necessary.

## 8. Write a narrative description for each scene/chapter.
Take each row of the spreadsheet and expand it to a multi-paragraph description of the scene.

- Put in any cool lines of dialogue you think of, and flesh out the essential conflict of that scene.
- If there’s no conflict, either add conflict or remove the scene.
- Think of it as the prototype first draft.

## 9. Write the first draft.
Just sit down and start pounding out the real first draft of the novel. You will be astounded at how fast the story flies out of your fingers at this stage.

- There are many small-scale logic problems to work out here.
- About midway through a first draft, take a breather and fix all the broken parts of the design documents.
- The design documents are not fixed in concrete, they are a living set of documents that grows as you develop your novel.
- If you are doing your job right, at the end of the first draft you will laugh at what an amateurish piece of junk your original design documents were, and you’ll be thrilled at how deep your story has become.
